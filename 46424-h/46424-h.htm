<h2 class="p4">Foreword</h2>

<p class="pn2">With the unprecedented increase in our commercial
activities has come a demand for better business
methods. Methods which were adequate for the
business of a less active commercial era, have given way to
systems and labor-saving ideas in keeping with the financial
and industrial progress of the world.</p>

<p class="pn1">Out of this progress has risen a new literature&mdash;the
literature of business. But with the rapid advancement in
the science of business, its literature can scarcely be said to
have kept pace, at least, not to the same extent as in other
sciences and professions. Much excellent material dealing
with special phases of business activity has been prepared,
but this is so scattered that the student desiring to acquire
a comprehensive business library has found himself confronted
by serious difficulties. He has been obliged, to a great extent,
to make his selections blindly, resulting in many duplications
of material without securing needed information on important
phases of the subject.</p>

<p class="pn1">In the belief that a demand exists for a library which
shall embrace the best practice in all branches of business&mdash;from
buying to selling, from simple bookkeeping to the
administration of the financial affairs of a great corporation&mdash;these
volumes have been prepared. Prepared primarily for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
use as instruction books for the American School of Correspondence,
the material from which the Cyclopedia has been
compiled embraces the latest ideas with explanations of the
most approved methods of modern business.</p>

<p class="pn1">Editors and writers have been selected because of their
familiarity with, and experience in handling various subjects
pertaining to Commerce, Accountancy, and Business Administration.
Writers with practical business experience have
received preference over those with theoretical training;
practicability has been considered of greater importance than
literary excellence.</p>

<p class="pn1">In addition to covering the entire general field of business,
this Cyclopedia contains much specialized information not
heretofore published in any form. This specialization is particularly
apparent in those sections which treat of accounting
and methods of management for Department Stores, Contractors,
Publishers and Printers, Insurance, and Real Estate.
The value of this information will be recognized by every
student of business.</p>

<p class="pn1">The principal value which is claimed for this Cyclopedia
is as a reference work, but, comprising as it does the material
used by the School in its correspondence courses, it is offered
with the confident expectation that it will prove of great
value to the trained man who desires to become conversant
with phases of business practice with which he is unfamiliar,
and to those holding advanced clerical and managerial
positions.</p>

<p class="pn1">In conclusion, grateful acknowledgment is made to authors
and collaborators, to whose hearty coöperation the excellence
of this work is due.</p>

<h2 class="p4">ADMINISTRATIVE AND INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION</h2>

<p class="p2"><b>1.</b> With little fear of contradiction, it may be stated that every
commercial enterprise is conducted with the one purpose in view of
making money for its owners. Naturally, the owners desire the
largest possible returns from their investment of money or time, or
both. Every person connected with the enterprise, in any capacity
whatsoever, is indirectly working for the same purpose&mdash;to make
as much money as possible for the owners of the business.</p>

<p>The largest possible volume of profitable business must be
transacted; the business must be conducted with economy; the
returns from each dollar expended must be as large as possible. This
very condition is one of the beneficial results of modern business
methods. The demand for a greater volume, lower cost of production,
and more economical methods, has brought with it an incentive to
greater effort on the part of the individual, with corresponding rewards.</p>

<p>That the efforts of the individual may be productive of best
results, he must have the coöperation of other individuals engaged
in the same enterprise. The enterprise must be properly organized.</p>

<p>Realizing the absolute necessity of harmoniously working organizations,
keen students of business affairs have given much study to
the question of how to organize a business. They have studied the
plans of operation of the most successful enterprises, for the purpose
of discovering those factors which have contributed most largely
to their success. They have investigated and improved old plans
and methods and invented new methods.</p>

<p><b>2. The Business Engineer.</b> The investigations of these men
have brought into being a new profession&mdash;that of the business
organizer or business engineer&mdash;a profession that has quickly gained
recognition. Business men, especially those at the head of large
enterprises have not been slow to avail themselves of the services of
men who have mastered the science of business organization.</p>

<p>For the same reason that he has long employed an architect to
plan his building the modern business man calls in a business engineer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
or systematizer, to perfect his business organization. As in
every other profession, some incompetent men are found posing as
business engineers, but an increasing number of trained men are
entering the field. It is the work of these men that is placing the profession
on a high plane.</p>

<p>The successful business engineer must have the ability to quickly
grasp the plan of operation of any business with which his work may
bring him in contact; he must be able to analyze conditions and to
determine the factors which make for the success or failure of a business.
His work is to organize and systematize every step of the
work in every department.</p>

<p><b>3. The Preliminary Investigation.</b> The first step in the organization
or systematizing of a business is to determine its natural
divisions. What is the nature of the business, and what are its distinguishing
characteristics? Be it a manufacturing, jobbing, wholesale,
retail, or professional concern, there is some one head on whom
rests the final responsibility for the success or failure of the business.
He must be surrounded with subordinates, each having certain duties
to perform, who will be responsible for the performance of those
duties, thereby coöperating to carry out the purposes of the enterprise.</p>

<p>The highest type of organization is found among the great industrial
enterprises. These enterprises with their many activities most
readily lend themselves to the application of scientific principles of
organization. Here, organization can be carried to its final conclusion;
in a smaller enterprise the same principles apply, but modification
of details is necessary.</p>

<p>If we study the organization of a large enterprise, regarding it
as a type, we can more readily grasp the requirements of a smaller
business. But it must be remembered that in any event, the individual
business must be studied and the organization made to fit the business.
A tailor does not cut all coats from the same pattern.</p>

<p>In certain respects a great industrial organization may be likened
to the army. At the head of the army is the commanding general,
on whom rests the responsibility for the success of any campaign.
He is surrounded by his staff, with whom he consults on questions of
importance. When any important move is decided upon, the members
of the staff&mdash;themselves in command of divisions of the army&mdash;issue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
orders to their subordinate officers. They, in turn, pass the
orders along, and at a predetermined moment, an entire army is set in
motion.</p>

<p>Another important feature of the army organization which should
be applied to the organization of a business is the disregard of the
individual. Military authorities long since discovered that a high
standard of efficiency could be maintained only through the organization
of the army along certain lines. The question was not one of
creating offices the duties of which would conform to the capabilities
of certain men; the offices were first created, and then competent men
were selected to fill them.</p>

<p><b>4. Individuals Disregarded.</b> In creating responsibilities in a
business organization, the individual should be disregarded, just as
he is in the army. Unfortunately, the importance of this question
is not always recognized. Too frequently the best interests of the
organization as a whole are subserved to the interests of individuals.
Business enterprises are organized and offices divided among the
principal owners without seriously considering their respective abilities.
This is wrong in principle, and works to the detriment of the
business. It is one of the important problems to be solved in organization.
Jones, who is a natural born financier, prefers to manage
the selling end of the business, while Brown, a salesman of ability, is
made treasurer. Neither is in the right place; change them about,
and an efficient team would result.</p>

<p>Before we can perfect an organization, we must know what the
business is. We must ascertain for what it is organized; what class
of business is carried on; manufacturing, mining, jobbing, wholesale,
retail, or a combination of two or more classes; whether conducted
entirely in one plant or through branches; the method of marketing
the goods; by traveling salesmen, agencies, or mail; the facilities
for obtaining supplies, raw materials, or manufactured goods. When
we understand the nature of the business, we are in a position to work
out an impersonal, systematic organization.</p>

<p>Referring again to the necessity of a disregard of individuals in
perfecting an organization, it is not the province of the business engineer
to determine the qualifications of the men. He must be governed
solely by the requirements of the business. When his work is completed,
it is for the management to decide who is best fitted to assume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the duties and carry out the purposes of the departments and positions
created.</p>

<p>We refer, for convenience, to the business engineer or systematizer;
the principle is the same whether the one doing the work is
acting in a professional capacity, perfecting the organization of his
employer's business, or even solving the problems of his own establishment.</p>


<h3 class="p2">OBJECTS AND CHARACTERISTICS OF ORGANIZATION</h3>

<p><b>5.</b> To reduce the subject to concrete form, the objects of business
organization may be defined as follows:</p>

<table id="t01" summary="t01">

 <tr>
  <td class="tdch">(A)</td>
  <td class="tdlp">To unite the individuals who are to conduct an enterprise into a
body which will work systematically to a common end.</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td class="tdch">(B)</td>
  <td class="tdlp">To bring together or group the component parts of the body with
respect to their specific relations and duties.</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td class="tdch">(C)</td>
  <td class="tdlp">To elect officers and appoint committees and authorities with
clearly defined duties and responsibilities.</td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p class="p1">These definitions all lead to a common center, that is, coöperation.
Without co-operation the success of any organization is very
questionable, if not impossible. With it&mdash;a body of men all working
together for a common end&mdash;almost any apparent obstacle will be
surmounted. No matter how large an organization may be, how
many or wide its ramifications, if the spirit of co-operation prevails,
it will move as one irresistible body.</p>

<p class="b1">And, regardless of the size or nature of a business enterprise, the
organization, as here used, resolves itself into certain easily distinguished
components, as follows:</p>

<div class="reduct">

<p>First: The owners, represented in a corporation by the stockholders or
investing public; in a partnership, by the partners; in an individual business,
by the proprietor.</p>

<p>Second: The executive or managerial division.</p>

<p>Third: The commercial or active business division.</p>

<p>Fourth: The manufacturing or productive division.</p>

</div>

<p class="p1">These components lend themselves naturally to certain specific
subdivisions; natural groups are formed to insure efficient management;
certain authorities are delegated to effect economical
operation.</p>

<p>The stockholders (owners) first elect from among their number,
a <i>board of directors</i>. This is the initial step toward perfecting a
business organization. The directors represent the stockholders,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
and the interest of the stockholder, as such, becomes that of an investor
only. His interest in the operation of the business is to be
looked after by the directors, whom he, or a majority, has elected.</p>

<p>From this board of directors is built the framework of the executive
or managerial division. The first act of the directors is to meet
and elect the usual executive officers: <i>President</i>, <i>Vice-President</i>,
<i>Secretary</i>, and <i>Treasurer</i>. In modern organizations, it is customary
to also elect or appoint an <i>executive committee</i> or <i>board of managers</i>.</p>

<p>This committee consists of three or more members, usually
selected from the officers, to which may be added one or more directors
who are not officers.</p>

<p>To this committee, the board of directors delegates its authority
in the actual conduct of the business. This plan of electing an executive
committee is particularly desirable when the board is a large
one, as it concentrates authority and results in more prompt action
on matters demanding immediate attention. A large body is unwieldy,
a quorum cannot always be brought together on short notice,
but a working majority of a small committee can be convened
promptly.</p>

<p>The executive committee takes charge of both the commercial
and manufacturing divisions. To still further concentrate authority,
it is customary to appoint a <i>General Manager</i> who has direct supervision
over the immediate operation of both commercial and manufacturing
divisions. He is appointed sometimes by the executive
committee, but more often by the board of directors.</p>

<p>The general manager, while occupying a position of chief acting
executive, acts with the executive committee and is directly responsible
to the board of directors.</p>

<p>The commercial division of a business naturally subdivides into
two sections: <i>Accounting</i>, and <i>Advertising and Sales</i>. The first
thought of the student might be that accounting is given a position of
too great importance, but in the sense here used it means the records
of the business of every nature, the accounts, the gathering and recording
of statistics and information of every character.</p>

<p>The manufacturing division divides into <i>Purchasing and Stores</i>,
and <i>Production</i>. In a measure, the purchasing of goods is a function of
the commercial division, but the purchasing of raw material and supplies
is properly under the supervision of the manufacturing division.</p>

<h3 class="p2">CHARTING THE ORGANIZATION</h3>

<p><b>6.</b> What may be termed the anatomy of an industrial body,
is most graphically shown by means of charts. Free use of charts
will be made throughout these papers. With properly designed
charts the logical divisions of authority or expense can be clearly
shown.</p>

<p>Fig. 1 furnishes a graphic illustration of the principal components
of the organization under discussion. In the first group we find the
owners (stockholders) whose line of communication with the business
is through the board of directors. Subordinate to the board of directors
are its own executive officers, the executive committee, and
general manager.</p>

<p>The connecting lines show the executive committee to be in
direct communication with the board of directors, while the general
manager is in direct communication with both the executive committee
and the board of directors.</p>

<p>Under the general manager are the commercial and manufacturing
divisions, over both of which he has direct supervision.</p>

<p><b>7. Working Authorities in Large Enterprises.</b> The next logical
step in the development of our organization is a study of the working
authorities and responsibilities of the different officers and their
assistants. We have seen that the administrative authority is for
practical purposes centered in the general manager. It is not to be
supposed, however, that in a large industrial organization he will
personally supervise all of the details of operation of the commercial
and manufacturing divisions. His time must not be taken up with
details which can be as well handled by subordinates. He should be
free to devote his time to questions of policy, the providing of finances,
the consideration of new fields of endeavor, and the making of the
more important contracts. His immediate assistants will be a
<i>Comptroller</i> and a <i>Superintendent</i>.</p>

<p>The comptroller fills a position identical with that of a business
manager or an assistant manager. His duties are mainly in connection
with the commercial division. It is his business to devise systems
of accounts and systems for recording the activities of every
department, and have reports compiled, in proper form for presentation
to the general manager. His is a statistical department, filling
a place between the general manager and the subordinate departments,
and, while not closing the avenues of communication between
these departments and the general manager, it is here that reports and
records of results are concentrated.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>The superintendent is in immediate charge of manufacturing
operations and is responsible for the custody of all property used in
manufacturing. His position does not close the avenue of communication
between factory departments and the general manager.</p>

<p>Fig. 2 illustrates the subdivisions of the commercial and manufacturing
branches. This chart does not go back of the administrative
section of the organization, as the stockholders have no direct
connection with the actual operation of the business.</p>

<p>We find the subdivisions of the commercial branch in charge of
the following: <i>Chief Accountant</i>, with direct supervision over all
bookkeeping and accounting records; <i>Chief Stenographer</i>, in charge
of all stenographic and circularizing work; <i>Advertising</i> and <i>Sales
Managers</i>, in charge of publicity and selling campaigns; <i>Credit man</i>,
in charge of credits and collections.</p>

<p>The manufacturing department includes the <i>Purchasing Agent</i>,
who purchases all manufacturing stores, materials, and supplies;
<i>Chief Stores clerk</i>, in charge of the storage of all materials and supplies;
<i>Chief Engineer</i>, who designs new products, new machinery
for the manufacture of that product, and conducts all experimental
work; <i>Chief Draftsman</i>, who superintends the work of the drafting
rooms; <i>Assistant Superintendent</i>, in charge of maintenance of power
and heating plants, internal transportation facilities, machinery
and buildings; <i>Foremen</i>, in charge of shops employed in production
work.</p>

<p>As shown by the lines of communication, represented by the
heavy lines, the authorities of the comptroller and superintendent
extend to every phase of the work of the commercial and manufacturing
branches. The comptroller is in communication with the
manufacturing branch since the making of schedules, time keeping,
and the assembling of cost statistics are all centered in his office.
He does not, however, assume any of the duties of the superintendent,
and while their work is closely related, the two officers conduct their
departments without conflict of authorities. It must be remembered
that they are equally responsible to the general manager, which of
itself requires cordial coöperation.</p>

<p><b>8. Organization Applied to Small Business.</b> We have referred
only to large manufacturing enterprises divided into many departments,
necessitating a division of executive duties among a large
number of minor executives. While, in the organization of a smaller
enterprise, not all of these department heads will be required, the
principles of organization, so far as division of authority is concerned,
remain the same.</p>

<p>In the small corporation, we find the same board of directors
elected by the stockholders. This board may be small, consisting
of no more than five, or even three members, but the same executive
officers are elected. One man may hold more than one office, as secretary
and treasurer, or vice-president and treasurer, yet each office is
filled. If the board is small the executive committee may be omitted,
in which case the board itself performs the duties of the executive
committee. There is the same general manager; at least the duties
exist even though there be no such office in name. The president
may act as the executive head, and be recognized as the actual manager
of the business, but in so doing he is acting in an entirely different
capacity than that pertaining to the office of president.</p>

<p>Extending the illustration to a small manufacturing enterprise,
the general manager may assume all of the duties of the comptroller
in the operation of the commercial branch; he may be his own sales
manager or credit man; or in the manufacturing branch, he may act as
superintendent.</p>

<p>The treasurer of the corporation may be the accountant and
also act as credit man. The advertising and sales managers may
be one, or the superintendent may be the purchasing agent as well.</p>

<p>The point intended to be emphasized is that there are certain
duties to be performed, certain responsibilities to be met, certain
authorities to be assumed even though it be but a one-man business.
And in this is illustrated the importance of creating any business
organization without regard to individuals.</p>

<p><b>9. Organization of Mercantile Business.</b> Leaving for a time
the organization of a manufacturing enterprise, we will consider the
application of the principles of organization to a trading business.
In such a business, the administrative section remains the same:
stockholders, directors, officers, executive committee, general manager.
At this point the business naturally divides into the departments of
<i>buying</i> and <i>selling</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-027.jpg" width="400" height="656"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 3. A Chart of a Corporate Trading Enterprise</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>The buying department is subdivided into <i>purchasing</i>, <i>stock</i>,
and <i>shipping</i>. The subdivisions of the sales department are <i>sales</i>
and <i>accounting</i>. Our chart of the organization shown in Fig. 3,
follows the same lines as Fig. 1, the only change being in the main
divisions.</p>

<p>Advancing the next step we find the executive officers in charge
of the several divisions of the work, corresponding very closely to
those shown in Fig. 2. The buying department is in charge of the
<i>Purchasing Agent</i>, <i>Chief Stock Clerk</i>, and <i>Shipping Clerk</i>, or <i>Traffic
Manager</i>, as he is sometimes known.</p>

<p>The selling department is in charge of the <i>Chief Accountant</i>,
<i>Advertising Manager</i>, <i>Sales Manager</i>, and <i>Credit Man</i>. This is
shown clearly in the chart, Fig. 4.</p>

<p>Lest an erroneous impression be gained, it may be well to state
at this point that the advertising and sales managers must work in
perfect harmony. Indeed, advertising is one branch of the sales
department and the success of one is so closely interwoven with the
other that no important step should be taken by either independently.</p>

<p>In many large concerns, the sales manager is the real advertising
manager, even though another may supervise the actual routine of
preparing advertising matter. A competent advertising man makes
a successful sales manager, and every sales manager should have
advertising training, for the purpose of advertising is to create a
demand and assist in making sales.</p>

<p>Referring again to Fig. 4, it is seen that both buying and selling
departments are under the control of the general manager, from whom
direct lines of communication lead to every division of these departments.
Direct communication is also maintained between the two
departments. The accounting division keeps the accounts of the
buying department; the sales division must be in communication
with the purchasing and stock division in respect to maintaining the
stock to be sold, and with the shipping division in respect to the filling
of orders.</p>

<p><b>10. Universal Application of Organization Principles.</b> When
we go into all of the ramifications of business we find many establishments
where minor variations of our plan of organization appear
necessary, but in the final analysis, the fundamentals prove to be the
same.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-029.jpg" width="400" height="667"
         alt=""

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 4. Chart of Working Authorities in a Trading Business</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Reduced to its simplest form, we will suppose the business under
consideration to be a small retail establishment conducted by two
partners. No thought has been given to the principles of organization,
yet they are applied in that little store just as surely as in the immense
manufacturing plant.</p>

<p>Ask any commercial salesman calling on the firm who is the man
to see regarding the introduction of a new line of goods, and he will
probably answer, "Mr. Jones is the man to see; he does the buying."
With no thought of organization, the owners of this little business
realize that it is best for one man to do the buying. Perhaps the other
may inspect samples, his opinion may be asked, he may even place an
occasional order, but it is not the rule of the establishment. By
placing the buying in the hands of one partner, confusion is avoided.
He can keep in closer touch with prices, and the results are far more
satisfactory.</p>

<p>Advancing to the larger retail business of the department store,
whether the general store of the small town or the big store of the
city, we find a different problem. Here the buying is further specialized,
for one man buys for one, or at most three or four departments.
The same men act as sales managers and buyers in the departments
for which they are responsible. The manager of a department in a
big store is selected as much for his ability as a buyer as for his salesmanship.
But we do not get away from fundamental principles,
for in buying and selling the manager is performing two entirely
separate and distinct functions.</p>

<p class="b1">No matter what the business, we find the same two fundamental
functions, that is, buying and selling. As illustrations of the application
of this principle to different businesses we give the following:</p>

<p class="pbq">Publishers of newspapers and other periodicals buy editorial work,
manuscript, engraving, paper, printing; sell subscriptions, advertising space.</p>

<p class="pbq">Publishers of books buy editorial work, manuscript, engraving, paper,
printing; sell books.</p>

<p class="pbq">Railroad companies buy equipment, rails, lumber, coal, supplies, labor;
sell freight and passenger transportation.</p>

<p class="pbq">Schools and colleges buy textbooks, supplies, services of instructors;
sell instruction.</p>

<p class="pbq">Professional men buy their instruction, books, instruments, office furnishings,
clerical assistance; sell their services.</p>

<p class="p1">In every undertaking, revenues are produced through salesmanship.
Every business and every profession has something to sell,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
and its financial success depends largely upon the quality of salesmanship
employed. Whether it be a professional man with nothing
but his services to sell and no other means of advertising than through
work well done, or a gigantic commercial organization with its extensive
advertising campaign and many salesmen, a selling organization
exists in some form. And before anything can be sold it must be
procured, or bought.</p>

<p class="b1">On this question of the universal application of the principles
of organization, we quote from a valuable contribution in <i>The Engineering
Magazine</i>, by C. E. Knoeppel:</p>

<p class="pbq">"While business as it is now conducted is not as simple as it was in the
barter days, it must not be inferred that this segregation of authority is synonymous
with complexity, for its very purpose has been to simplify, and that
is what it has accomplished. It is only where this segregation has been the
result of lack of thought and proper attention, or other like causes, that we
find a complex and unsatisfactory condition of affairs. In fact, there is all
about us sufficient evidence that many commercial enterprises are being conducted
along lines that, as far as evolutional development is concerned, are
several stages behind the times.</p>

<p class="pbq">"Let us suppose a case, which will apply in a greater or less degree to
the majority. In the earlier development, we will say that the founder of
the business was able, on account of its small size, to make what sketches he
needed, solicit orders, see that they were filled, perhaps take a hand at the
making if occasion required, see to the shipments, and attend to the collections
and the keeping of his few accounts. He finds that the business grows, and
eventually places a man in charge of certain branches while he looks after
others. The accounts eventually require more attention than he can give
them so he engages a bookkeeper in order that he may be relieved of the work.
He finds that the quantity of materials received and shipped amount to enough
to warrant a receiving clerk as well as a shipping clerk, and, to handle this
material from its inception to shipment he conceives the idea of placing a man
in charge as stock clerk. He then adds a purchasing agent, in order that he
may be relieved of the detail and that purchases may be made most economically;
a man is placed in charge of the orders; foremen are placed in charge
of certain men in the shops; the details connected with making plans, drawings,
estimates, etc., are taken over by a practical man; his manager is given
a man to look after the shops or engineering branch; while the commercial
branch with its many details is placed in the hands of another. As the evolution
continues, the selling branch is assumed by one man; cost details are
looked after by another; a chief inspector is added in order that all work
may be shipped according to specifications; the engineer, who before had
been a sort of jack of all trades, is placed in charge of certain work, while an
electrician is engaged to look after this particular work; and so this segregation
continues as the development continues.</p>

<p class="pbq">"Perhaps it is not to be wondered at that the founder, in looking backward,
is inclined to pat himself on the back when, in a reminiscent mood, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
considers what he terms 'remarkable development.' He considers that he has
been wonderfully successful in building up a business which at the beginning
was so small as to admit of his supervising every detail, while today he employs
a dozen men to do the work he once did. There is no getting away from
the fact that it is this same feeling of self-satisfaction that is responsible for a
large number of faulty organizations, for if we should tell this manufacturer
that his business is far from being as successful as it is possible for it to be ...
he would vigorously resent any such accusation; but the fact remains that it is
not the success it should be, for the very reason that the development has been
allowed practically to take care of itself. New men were added, new offices
created, only when absolutely necessary, each newcomer being given a general
idea of what was expected of him, and not knowing, not thinking, or perhaps
not having the time to give more than passing attention to the matter, the
proprietor did not consider the fact that his business was a unit, with each
worker a part, having a distinct relation with every other worker. Hence, as
the efficiency of any organization is directly in proportion to the care with
which these relations are considered and treated, his organization naturally
fails to attain that degree of efficiency obtainable, and for this condition he,
and he only is responsible."</p>

<p class="p1"><b>11. Departmental Authorities.</b> The next logical step in the
development of our organization is an analysis of the departmental
organizations. We have seen how the operations of the business are
divided among several divisions or departments. The reason
for such divisions is apparent. In a large business no one
man can personally supervise all of its activities. Each division
is engaged in certain activities that demand the immediate
supervision of specialists. One man is a specialist in advertising,
another in sales plans, others in purchasing, specific manufacturing
operations, or the design and maintenance of appliances intended
to improve the product or to reduce costs.</p>

<p>To reach the highest state of efficiency in every department of
the business, these specialists must be employed, which is another
reason for organizing a business along the line of its activities, and
without respect to individuals.</p>

<p>Before we can decide what manner of man should be placed at
the head of this or that department, we must study the duties of the
position, the responsibilities involved, the authorities to be assumed.
To present this problem in graphic form, the chart (Fig. 5) is designed.
While the arrangement is not inconsistent with Fig. 2, this
chart of the same class of organization is laid out along the lines of
authority. It shows both the authority of the department head and
the necessary activities of his division.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>We have selected the organization of a large industrial establishment
for the very reason that many divisions and departments are
necessary. The smaller organization will have a less number of
divisions, but it is much easier to condense than to expand a given
plan. Any man who understands the requirements of a large organization
can readily adapt those ideas to a smaller establishment. He
can apply the plan so far as it can be used to advantage. Some
variations of the application of the plan will be pointed out in our
departmental analysis.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 5. A Chart Which Shows the Duties, Responsibilities and Authorities to be
Assumed by Each Department Head</p>
</div></div>

<p>It is perhaps unnecessary to say that while the authorities of
some of the department heads have been referred to in preceding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
pages, this analysis is intended to exhibit these authorities in greater
detail.</p>

<p><b>12. General Manager.</b> As a rule the general manager has
general supervision over the commercial and manufacturing branches.
In conjunction with the president and executive committee, he formulates
all policies to be followed in purchasing, manufacturing, sales,
and advertising, establishing credits, and accounting methods. He
is responsible to the executive committee and board of directors for
procuring materials, their manufacture and sale, and the maintenance
of buildings and machinery.</p>

<p>It is his duty to keep in touch with the operations of every department
and to post himself on the general efficiency of all classes
of workmen. Through reports he will keep informed in regard to
the results of the operations of every department.</p>

<p>While in direct communication with all department and division
heads, he will have for his immediate assistants, a comptroller and a
superintendent. It is from the comptroller that he will receive
statistics and reports of the activities of the business in all its branches,
while to the superintendent he delegates his authority in the actual
operation of the manufacturing branch.</p>

<p><b>13. Comptroller.</b> "A controller or manager" is a standard
definition of the term comptroller. In the organization under consideration,
he is a <i>controller</i> of the business by virtue of the fact that
he is responsible for the accounting and recording of all activities of
the business.</p>

<p>He occupies the position of auditor and is the real systematizer
of the business. He creates all systems of commercial accounting, cost
accounting, departmental records, time keeping, and pay rolls, reports
of superintendent, perpetual inventory, sales statistics, and, in fact, all
records of the business. He prepares all balance sheets, comparative
statements, trading, manufacturing, and profit and loss statements, and
reports to the general manager or executive committee, or both, on
the condition of finances, materials, and finished goods.</p>

<p>Since the formation of important policies may hinge on the
reports and statistics of his department, he occupies an office next
in importance to the general manager. The training and experience
gained in his office place him in direct line for promotion to the office of
general manager.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>His authority is absolute over the accounting and stenographic
departments, while his authority extends to other departments only
in respect to their record systems. In the accounting department,
his direct assistant is the chief accountant; and in the stenographic,
the chief stenographer.</p>

<p>In a smaller organization the comptroller may not require the
services of a chief accountant, in which case he performs the duties
of the position. Or the treasurer may occupy the office of comptroller.</p>

<p><i>Chief Accountant.</i> The chief accountant is in immediate charge
of the commercial and factory accounting. His assistants are cashier,
bookkeepers, factory accountant, cost clerks, time clerks.</p>

<p>This department accounts for the receipt and disbursement of all
moneys and properties, figures costs and pay rolls, and prepares
statistics necessary for the use of the comptroller in making up his
reports and statements.</p>

<p>It is evident from this that the comptroller is in a sense the custodian
of all property belonging to the business, since he must, through
his accounting department, account for its receipt and disbursement.
This explains why the comptroller prescribes all systems for the care
and recording of stores, supplies, and finished product.</p>

<p><i>Chief Stenographer.</i> The chief stenographer is at the head of the
correspondence department, with authority over all stenographers,
typists, filing and mailing clerks.</p>

<p>Stenographers are supplied to all divisions by this department.
This plan of having all stenographers in one department subject to
the call of those having need of their services is now adopted by most
large concerns, except in a few cases where stenographers act as private
secretaries to the officers. The plan is an economical one, for only
the number actually required to handle the work of the establishment
need be employed. Under the old plan of employing one or more
stenographers in each department, it is common to find them idle in
one department while in another the work is behind. Another
strong point in favor of the more modern plan is that each stenographer
becomes familiar with the dictation of all departments, and
no stenographer has an opportunity to become familiar with the
secrets of the business.</p>

<p>In the stenographic department, the work of addressing and
mailing form letters, catalogues, and circulars is done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>All correspondence is filed by this department.</p>

<p>Records of office supplies, stationery and printed matter are
maintained in this department.</p>

<p>The chief stenographer has charge of and accounts for all postage,
but secures postage by requisition from the cashier or accountant.</p>

<p><b>14. Sales Division.</b> By far the most important division of the
entire commercial branch is the sales division. This division is
responsible for finding a market for the output of the business.</p>

<p>It must create a demand for the product through advertising,
open new fields, study the demands of the trade and the products of
competitors, ascertain as far as may be the possibilities of marketing
new products, and, above all, sell goods at a profit.</p>

<p>The selling division of some of the largest industrial establishments
is in sole charge of a general sales manager, who has authority
over the advertising as well as selling. In our chart we have divided
responsibility for the conduct of this division between sales and advertising
managers, placing the advertising manager on an equality
with, rather than subordinate to, the sales manager. This combination
will produce the most satisfactory results for most enterprises.</p>

<p><i>Advertising Manager.</i> The advertising manager has charge of
the preparation of all advertising literature, catalogues, copy and
designs for all periodical advertising and usually the placing of all
contracts for printing and engraving.</p>

<p>He has authority over all artists and copy writers employed
regularly and for special work.</p>

<p>With the sales manager and general manager, he makes up
appropriations for periodical advertising and places contracts when
these appropriations have been approved.</p>

<p>He confers with the sales manager on all questions pertaining
to his work, no printed matter for the use of the selling division being
ordered until approved by the sales manager. Thus, coöperation
of the sort that makes for success is assured.</p>

<p><i>Sales Manager.</i> The sales manager has authority over the sale
of goods and filling of orders, and his department is divided into
selling and filling. The selling department is further subdivided
into salesmen and mail orders.</p>

<p>One subdivision represents that portion of the sales made by
personal salesmen. The active work is carried on by salesmen who
call on the trade under the orders of the sales manager.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>The sales manager hires all salesmen, prescribes their territories
and routes, and supervises their expense accounts.</p>

<p>He compiles reports and statistics of their work for presentation
to the comptroller or general manager, and keeps the records prescribed
for this department.</p>

<p>The mail order division is engaged in the sale of goods by the
use of letters, circulars, and catalogues. Lists of customers and
prospective customers are maintained, and sales follow-up systems
are operated under the immediate supervision of this division.</p>

<p>In the filling department, the chief order clerk is in charge of
entering sales orders, making shipping orders and manufacturing
orders. He maintains a record of sales and manufacturing orders
so that he can keep informed on manufacturing or stock requirements.
All invoicing of shipments is done in this department.</p>

<p>The shipping clerk maintains records of rates of transportation
by rail, water, or truck, and keeps posted on routes and facilities.
He supervises the packing of all goods, and secures proper receipts
from transportation lines.</p>

<p><i>Credit Man.</i> The position of the credit man is an important one
in any establishment.</p>

<p>He collects and records information about the financial responsibility
and credit standing of customers. When necessary, he makes
special investigations, and on the basis of his information extends or
limits credit. Every order from a new customer must be approved
by the credit man before it can be accepted.</p>

<p>When accounts have been opened, it is the duty of the credit man
to collect them when due, or, if not paid promptly, to use every means
to secure a settlement. His work brings him in contact with both
the sales and accounting departments.</p>

<p>The credit man is assisted by such clerks and collectors as may
be necessary for the conduct of his department.</p>

<p><b>15. Superintendent.</b> The superintendent is given general supervision
over the manufacturing branch of the business. His authority
extends directly to the engineering and drafting departments, the
work of the assistant superintendent, foreman of tool room, and shop
foremen. His relations with the purchasing department are advisory
rather than managerial.</p>

<p>His immediate assistants are the chief engineer, assistant superintendent,
and shop foremen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>It is his duty to execute orders for the manufacture of goods,
operate the plant in the most economical manner, study and introduce
processes and methods that tend to reduce manufacturing costs,
and keep informed generally on the efficiency of men, machinery,
appliances, and materials in all manufacturing departments.</p>

<p>With the assistance of the purchasing agent he provides all
materials and supplies required in the manufacture of goods or for
the operation of the plant.</p>

<p><i>Chief Engineer.</i> The chief engineer designs all special machinery
and appliances to be manufactured for use in the plant,
designs and plans all new products for which there appears to be a
demand, and personally supervises the experimental department.
The installation of new equipment is also done under his supervision.</p>

<p>His authority extends to the drafting department which is in
charge of a chief draftsman. This department draws all designs,
plans of new machinery or product, and all plans not classed as
architectural.</p>

<p>In a plant where many special tools are made, the chief engineer
also has authority over the tool room.</p>

<p><i>Assistant Superintendent.</i> The assistant superintendent is responsible
for the maintenance in efficient condition of all power,
pumping, heating, and lighting plants, internal transportation facilities,
and the repair of buildings and equipment.</p>

<p>Except in the larger plants, he has authority over the tool room
which is placed in charge of a tool room foreman. This department
is responsible for the custody of all tools, repairs to tools, and their
manufacture. Tools are issued only on requisition and perpetual
inventories are maintained according to systems prescribed.</p>

<p>In some very large industrial plants, like a steel plant, there are
several assistant superintendents, each having specific duties. There
may be a superintendent of power, superintendent of transportation,
superintendent of machinery, superintendent of buildings, superintendent
of stores, etc. In a small plant, the superintendent will
personally perform the duties here assigned to the assistant superintendent.</p>

<p><i>Shop Foremen.</i> As the name indicates, the shop foremen are in
charge of the various shops or manufacturing departments. It is
the duty of the shop foreman to lay out the work called for by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
orders of the superintendent, and to assign the work to his men. He
will make provision for the prompt execution of orders by making
requisition for the number of men that can be profitably employed in
his department. It is his duty to keep all of his men supplied with work.</p>

<p><b>16. Purchasing Agent.</b> The purchasing agent has charge of
the purchase of all materials for the manufacturing branch, and in
some cases for the commercial branch. In a purely trading concern,
his duties would be in connection with the commercial or selling
branch, but in a large industrial enterprise, the purchase of office
supplies, advertising literature, etc., is usually under the supervision
of the comptroller, chief accountant or advertising manager.</p>

<p>He procures catalogues, price lists, names of manufacturers
and dealers, and keeps generally informed as to sources of supply.
He obtains samples which are submitted to tests by the engineering
department or otherwise.</p>

<p>With the superintendent and general manager, he makes schedules
of materials, secures bids, and places orders. Records of orders and
all information needed in his office are kept according to the systems
prescribed by the comptroller.</p>

<p>He has full authority over the store rooms, in which he is assisted
by the chief stores clerk. This department receives all goods, checks
receipts with orders or invoices, stores the goods, delivers them on
properly executed requisitions, and maintains perpetual inventory
records as prescribed.</p>

<h3 class="p2">EMPLOYMENT DEPARTMENT</h3>

<p><b>17.</b> A department, or rather a sub-department, not shown on
the chart but found in some establishments, is the <i>employment
department</i>. This department is very properly in immediate charge
of the superintendent, and, in the average manufacturing plant, he
will hire all men. In a plant employing a great number of men, it
is impossible for the superintendent to personally take charge of this
work, and an employment agent is placed in charge.</p>

<p>The employment agent keeps records of all employes and applicants
and hires all men needed by the different foremen.</p>

<h3 class="p2">GENERAL MODIFICATIONS</h3>

<p><b>18.</b> The organization that we have described is a representative
illustration of the application of the principles to a large enterprise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
necessitating a considerable number of subdivisions. But even here
the charts show only what may be termed the principal divisions; the
charts might be extended in greater detail. The explanation might
include the exact duties of every employe in each department, but,
as our purpose is to present general principles in sufficient detail to
serve as a guide, explanations of these minute details have been
omitted.</p>

<p>There are, however, modifications to be found in certain cases
which may be made clear by further suggestions. We have referred
to the comptroller, and while in many concerns no such office is recognized,
at least by that title, some man in every business of any magnitude
fills an analogous position.</p>

<p>Most frequently it is the auditor, or if the office of auditor has
not been created, it may be the treasurer. Again, the duties or a
greater part of them, may fall on the office manager or the chief
accountant. Even in a small partnership where one of the partners
is the bookkeeper, the duties exist, and are performed by that partner
who keeps the accounts. It must be remembered that the comptroller's
office is primarily statistical. It matters not whether the
statistical operations involve the keeping of a simple set of books
or require large commercial and factory accounting forces with a
third division to compile statistics from their records, every business
demands certain statistical work. Neither is it important whether
the man in charge of this work be called comptroller, auditor, accountant
or office manager, but we have used the title of comptroller
as more exactly descriptive of the functions of the office when carried
to its legitimate conclusion in a large business.</p>

<p>While, in most manufacturing industries, the superintendent and
purchasing agent have full authority in the making of purchases for
the manufacturing branch, it has been found advisable in some cases
to give the comptroller authority over the purchasing department.
A reason for this is the importance of reducing the investment in raw
material, supplies, etc., to the lowest point consistent with the actual
requirements of the business. Much needless capital is tied up in
raw material, when it might be at least earning bank interest. His
chief concern being to provide a liberal supply of raw materials, the
superintendent is very liable to overstep the bounds in the direction
of too liberal purchases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>A still different condition is found in a large merchandising
establishment. Here practically every department manager is his
own buyer and while he must be regarded as the best judge of what to
buy, it becomes necessary to supervise his purchases in respect to
quantities. The comptroller should, therefore, have authority over
the amounts invested by the several buyers. This is usually controlled
by giving the buyer a stated appropriation at the beginning
of each season, the amount being determined by a study of present
conditions and records of past performance. The making of an
appropriation does not operate against special appropriations to be
used in taking advantage of specially advantageous market conditions,
or to increase stocks of fast selling lines.</p>

<h3 class="p2">DUTIES CLEARLY DEFINED</h3>

<p><b>19.</b> One of the first requirements in the development of a successful
organization is that the duties of every employe be clearly
defined, and that each employe be fully informed as to his duties.
Nothing tends to produce greater friction than an overlapping of
duties and authorities.</p>

<p>In a manufacturing plant, when a foreman is placed in charge
of a shop he should be instructed as to his authority, responsibilities,
and exact duties. When these authorities have once been established,
no other man of equal or lower grade in the organization should be
permitted to interfere in any way, nor should the foreman be permitted
to overstep his authority.</p>

<p>Those occupying positions to which greater authorities are
attached should also be careful to not presume upon their authority
by attempting to direct work properly under control of the foreman.
The superintendent or manager who, in passing through a plant, discovers
a workman in the act of violating an established rule, or doing
something dangerous to the lives of himself and fellow employes, or
performing work in the wrong way, is justified in at once bringing
the matter to the notice of that workman; but he should report the
occurrence to the foreman at the first opportunity.</p>

<p>On the contrary, if the manager or superintendent wishes to
make a change in policy involving a departure from the established
customs of the shop, or if he requires the services of a workman even
temporarily in another department, he should first take up the matter
with the shop foreman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>The same policy in general should be observed throughout the
organization. The person placed at the head of a department or
division of the work should have full authority and be held responsible
for the work of all employes in that department. Complaints of inefficiency
of an individual employe should be made to the department
head. If the purchasing agent, for instance, finds the work of a certain
stenographer unsatisfactory, his complaint should be made to
the chief stenographer.</p>

<p><b>20. Duties of Individual Workmen.</b> The duties of the individual
workman in the shop should be as clearly defined as are those
of his foreman. It is the duty of the foreman to lay out the work and
to keep the workman regularly employed on the work assigned to
him.</p>

<p>In the operation of the manufacturing branch, the most important
consideration is economy of production. When a workman is
kept at one task he becomes a specialist, increases his production, and
reduces costs.</p>

<p><b>21. Duties of Office Employes.</b> Each clerk in the office should
have his work clearly defined. If specialization is profitable in the
shop, it is equally so in the office. Every man who has been responsible
for the management of an office will agree with us that in no other
branch of business is there a greater tendency to allow work to get
behind.</p>

<p>Lack of system is mainly responsible for this state of affairs.
While his duties may be more or less clearly defined, the work of the
average office clerk does not follow any well defined plan. He does
the thing that seems most important, leaving the less important tasks
until he "has time." Instead of surveying the field and laying out a
logical, systematic plan, the average office employe goes about his
work in a haphazard sort of way following the line of least resistance.</p>

<p>The work in every office is largely routine, but the faithful performance
of routine tasks is a necessary accompaniment to those
larger tasks, which in themselves, appear of greater importance.
Routine tasks are drudgery&mdash;something that every man seeks to
escape. In freeing himself from a state of drudgery, the department
head should be careful lest he place his subordinates in the same
dreaded rut. An office clerk should be given an opportunity to learn
all of the routine of the division in which he is employed. He will
become a more valuable employe; while adding variety, the performance
of more than one task is training him for a more advanced position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 6. A Working Chart for the Guidance of the Employes in One Department</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>To properly systematize the routine, the department head should
first study his department to find out what the routine tasks really
are&mdash;what work must be done each day or each week. He should
then list these tasks and assign them to certain clerks to be performed
at certain stated times.</p>

<p>This can be best presented by means of a chart as shown in Fig. 6.
This chart covers the work of a typical general accounting department.
At the top, the general or routine tasks are listed, grouped
under proper divisions. From each task listed a line is extended to
the time when it is to be performed: daily, the day of the week, day
of the month, or the month. The letters at the end of the lines indicate
by whom the tasks are to be performed, <i>C</i> representing clerks, <i>B</i>,
bookkeepers, and <i>A</i>, cashier.</p>

<p>Taking the collection division as an illustration, we will suppose
that it is Monday, the 2nd of the month. The chart shows that on
Monday notices of notes and accounts due are to be mailed. On the
second day of the month, past due accounts must be taken up and disposed
of. In addition are the daily tasks as indicated by the lines
extending to the daily line.</p>

<p>When a task is to be performed two or three times in a month,
the line is broken and the letter inserted at each break. Even the
time of drawing off a balance sheet, once every three months, is
indicated. A similar chart should be made to show the routine
duties of each department.</p>

<p>Such charts, supplying, as they do, complete working schedules
for the routine of each department, soon reduce the time taken by
routine tasks, which is of no little importance in the conduct of a
well regulated department. They fill a place in office routine analogous
to that of the working plan in the shop. The same idea can
be carried out, and will prove equally valuable, even in an office
where the bookkeeper does all of the work.</p>

<h3 class="p2">CHARTING SALARY AND WAGE DISTRIBUTION</h3>

<p><b>22.</b> We have seen how authorities, responsibilities and even
routine duties are most graphically represented by means of charts&mdash;the
working plans of the recording divisions of the business. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
purposes of record, the distribution of the expenditures for salaries
and wages of those who make up our organization is of equal importance
to the definition of the authorities and duties.</p>

<p>If the accounts are to be of value they must be correct, and they
cannot be correct unless every item is charged to the proper account.
The value of correct accounts is recognized. They do more than
show what we have received or the expenditures for a specific purpose
during a stated period; they show when and why an expense is increased
or decreased. With such information to point the way to
economies in the future, instead of records that show us merely the
amount of an expense already incurred, accounting takes its rightful
place as one of the most important functions of a business enterprise.</p>

<p>Probably more businesses have failed owing to the lack of proper
accounting methods than from any one other cause. Many a business
has been rejuvenated&mdash;turned from failure to success&mdash;by the
introduction of a system of accounts that truthfully portrays its activities.
Few business failures are the result of a failure to buy goods at
right prices, or to establish selling prices that show a profit. The
more usual cause is found in leaks in the expense account. Any
method that locates the leaks places us in position to stop them.</p>

<p>The chief value of accounting records lies in the opportunity
afforded for comparison. The fact that a certain expense amounted
to $900.00 last month furnishes no information of special value; but
when compared with the amount expended for the same purpose
two, three and four months ago (if these expenses are analyzed and
compared with production or sales or whatever factor would affect
the amount) the figures assume an important significance. But if
expenditures are erroneously applied, if an amount has crept into an
expense account that does not belong there, the comparison had better
not have been made. Thus is seen the necessity of an absolutely
accurate distribution.</p>

<p>Here the chart&mdash;the working plan&mdash;is again applied to excellent
advantage. The chart, Fig. 7, applied to salary and wage distribution,
shows to which of the two principal divisions each item
should be charged. This is the important question&mdash;to properly
apply expenses to the commercial and manufacturing branches.
Subdivisions of such a chart segregating expenses of each division
are easily made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>The application of the items from which lines lead only to the
commercial or manufacturing branch is readily understood. Between
the two are several items from which lines lead to both branches,
indicating that the expense is to be divided. This division should
be given close study. Care must be used that too large a part of any
item is not applied to either branch. The salary of the general
manager, and usually the comptroller, will be equally divided. The
duties of the chief accountant, chief stenographer and stenographers
being chiefly in connection with the commercial branch, only a small
portion of their salaries is charged to manufacturing. Shipping
clerk and packers' salaries are charged to either one or the other
branch, depending upon the nature of the enterprise. In a manufacturing
enterprise where all goods are delivered to stock rooms
ready for shipment, packing and shipping is a sales expense and is
charged to the commercial branch; in a plant building heavy machinery
that must be shipped from the assembling floor, this expense
is usually charged to manufacturing.</p>

<h3 class="p2">EXPENSE DISTRIBUTION CHART</h3>

<p><b>23.</b> To present a graphic record of expense distribution, the
chart, Fig. 8, is used. This chart separates commercial and manufacturing
expense, showing amounts, while Fig. 7 shows to which
branch each item belongs.</p>

<p>This chart subdivides commercial expense into <i>executive</i>, <i>accounting</i>,
<i>office</i>, <i>sales</i>, and <i>credits and collections</i>, showing totals for
each and for the entire commercial branch. Manufacturing expense is
subdivided into <i>executive</i>, <i>accounting</i>, <i>purchasing</i>, <i>engineering</i>, and
<i>shops and equipment</i>.</p>

<p>A comparison of these statements from month to month will
show just what every item is and indicate the slightest increase in
any class of expense. Similar charts can be readily prepared for
any business, segregating expenditures of each branch, division, or
department.</p>

<p>The distribution will naturally vary in different businesses and,
before this chart can be prepared, the exact distribution must be determined.
In this chart, packing and shipping is included as a commercial
expense, while, as stated previously, in some businesses it
would be a manufacturing expense. All such questions must be
decided before the chart is prepared.</p>

<h3 class="p2">EFFECT OF PHYSICAL ARRANGEMENT</h3>

<p><b>24.</b> However efficient the personal organization, satisfactory
results can be obtained only under proper environment. It is not
merely a question of pleasant surroundings for employes, but a financial
proposition; not a reform or a fad, but a money-making plan
that governs the engineer in laying out a plant.</p>

<p>This is not to be a discussion of welfare work, about which much
has been published. Our purpose is to point out the business economy
of a proper physical arrangement of office, store or factory as against
the wasteful methods of a systemless grouping of men and machinery.</p>

<p>The question of physical environment is a practical one that has
been solved by many enterprising concerns, and the subject is deserving
of careful study by the student of business organization.
While some hard-headed business men may regard the question of
minor importance, it is significant that the largest and most successful
enterprises, financially, are those in which employes have been supplied
with the most comforts, surrounded with approved safeguards,
and aided in their work by the latest appliances of proved worth.</p>

<p>There is an old axiom to the effect that even a good workman
cannot be expected to do good work with poor tools. It is equally
true that he cannot be expected to do good work in either unsanitary
or inconveniently arranged shops and offices.</p>

<p><b>25. Factory Plans.</b> The planning of a manufacturing plant is
a question for the engineer, rather than the accountant or business
organizer, but a few general remarks on the subject will not be out of
place in this paper.</p>

<p>It may be stated as a fundamental principle that the factory
should be planned to facilitate the movement of raw material from one
department to another. In the ideal factory, storage for raw material
will be provided where it can be economically received and easily
procured when needed in the factory. It should, if possible, be
close to the department in which the material is subjected to the first
operation.</p>

<p>The shops themselves should be arranged to facilitate the movement
of partly completed parts from one department or shop to
another. To illustrate, a foundry should be so located that castings
can be taken direct to the machine shop, or smith shop, not through
another shop or in a round-about way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>Likewise, the machine shop, if the process be continuous, should
be located next to the assembling department. Or, if a "parts" storeroom
is maintained, it should be located between the machine shop
and assembling department. Storage for completed goods should
be adjacent to the assembling department, and convenient to the
shipping room or platform.</p>

<p>The chart, Fig. 9, shows a typical layout of a manufacturing
plant operating both a foundry and wood shop. Naturally the
foundry and wood shop are as widely separated as possible. Storage
of foundry materials is provided for just outside of the foundry, while
lumber is convenient to the wood shop.</p>

<p>The arrows indicate the movement of raw materials through the
shops to the finished goods storeroom, and from thence to the shipping
platform. If these lines are traced it will be seen that at no point is
the material twice moved over the same ground. Each move takes
it to the next operation and one step nearer completion. Where
materials and parts enter a shop at two or more points, the lines are
merged, showing that these materials leave that shop as one piece,
part, or finished article. A feature underlying the whole plan is
economy in the movement of work in process. All work moves
<i>through</i> a shop, not back and forth in the shop.</p>

<p>The ideal conditions do not always exist, neither can they be
brought about in every case. Many plants, built in the past, have
been planned without due regard for these matters; their importance
was not appreciated and the buildings are so located that it is impossible
to secure entirely satisfactory results. However, if present
conditions are studied carefully, many improvements can be brought
about at slight expense. While, as we have intimated, this is a problem
for engineers, a number of cases might be cited where the accountant,
called in to systematize the accounting methods of a manufacturing
business, has suggested physical changes in the shops that have
resulted in marked reductions in costs.</p>


<p><b>26. Planning the Office.</b> The average office is arranged in a
very haphazard way. Departments are located with little regard for
their departmental relations; desks are placed where they fit best
rather than according to any preconceived plan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-052.jpg" width="400" height="234"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 9. Layout of a Typical Manufacturing Plant</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>Logical arrangement of the office has as great an influence on
the economical conduct of the work as does the physical arrangement
of the shop. The most important requisite in the layout of an office
is good light. While ideal conditions are impossible to attain in some
buildings used for offices, much can be accomplished by placing the
desks to take full advantage of the light that is available.</p>

<p>The writer once visited an office in which sixty or more people
were employed in one big room. Most of the light came from the
rear and practically all of the desks faced the light, which is recognized
as most injurious to eyesight. The manager of the office was asked
why the desks were not placed in proper position, and he replied that
they were placed so that the employes would sit with their backs to
the entrance, and not have their attention detracted from the work
by visitors. He considered this an important move, but overlooked
the more vital fact that his employes were not only ruining their eyesight
but were actually doing less work than would have been done
under more favorable conditions.</p>

<p>A change was consented to. As many of the desks as possible
were so placed that the worker would receive the light from the left;
some received it from the right and a few from the back. Three
months later this manager readily admitted that his employes were
turning out at least one-third more work, and their general health
was greatly improved.</p>

<p>The location of the departments and the private offices should
be carefully considered. Departments in which the work is of a
nature requiring frequent inter-communication should be located
as closely together as possible. For instance, the sales department
should not be placed between the order and accounting departments,
but the order department should be close to the accounting department,
with which it is in constant communication.</p>

<p>The workers in a department should be placed to facilitate the
movement of their work from one desk to another. Heads of departments
or chief clerks should be within easy reach of all employes in
the department, and accessible to the executive.</p>

<p>Offices of executives should be located with reference to their
duties. The sales manager and purchasing agent should be accessible
to the public. The general manager should be within easy
reach of other officers but not necessarily accessible to the public.</p>

<p>The importance of conveniently arranged offices is receiving
much serious thought, and many of the larger industrial enterprises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
are erecting ideal administration buildings. In all specially planned
buildings, the tendency is toward large rooms, rather than smaller
rooms separating the departments. A large room insures better
light and air, and space can be utilized to much better advantage.</p>

<p>Fig. 10 is a sketch of the first floor plan of the administration
building of one of the large industrial enterprises. This is, in many
respects, an ideal arrangement.</p>

<p>A noticeable feature is the location of the filing department
in the center of the main room. Here it is easily reached by all
departments.</p>

<p>At either side of the filing department are the sales and accounting
departments. In the sales department several sales managers' desks
will be noted, with desks for their assistants across a narrow aisle.
It happens that, in this particular business, sales are divided into departments
corresponding with the classes of goods manufactured,
with a sales manager for each department.</p>

<p>The accounting, order, and credit departments are conveniently
arranged, and the auditor is located where he can overlook the entire
office. Executive offices, across the front of the building, are accessible
to the public and those in the general offices.</p>

<p><b>27. Store Plans.</b> The subject of store plans is one of utmost
importance to the merchant. His success is influenced to a great
extent by the first impression received by the prospective customer.
If that impression is favorable, if he is greeted by an orderly, well
arranged store, if his comfort and convenience have been considered,
the customer will return and give to the store at least a part of his
patronage.</p>

<p>The old-fashioned general store, in which all sorts of merchandise
was sold, offered little to commend in respect to orderly arrangement.
As a rule, the goods were jumbled together in a confused mass with no
thought of segregating them in departments. Yet this country store,
found in every hamlet, was the forerunner of the department store of
today.</p>

<p>The advent of the department store was a case of adapting the
merchandising methods of the country village to the needs of the city.
A miscellaneous stock of merchandise, greater in size but similar in
character to the country store stock, was gathered in one big store and
subdivided into departments. To compete with one-line stores,
stocks must be equal in volume, which meant that the department
store must carry as large a stock of clothing or of shoes as the exclusive
clothing and shoe stores. The stocks must be as complete and as
well displayed; each department must be a fully stocked store, prepared
to meet the usual demands of a store of that character.</p>

<p>The department store of today is a model of systematic arrangement.
Not only are the goods grouped in departments, but the departments
are logically grouped and located to suit the convenience
of the customers. If one wishes to buy house furnishings, hardware,
or dishes, he will probably find them in adjoining departments.</p>

<p>But the departmental idea is by no means confined to the recognized
department store; it is a feature of every well regulated store
dealing in exclusive lines. Stocks of shoes, hardware, clothing, and
furnishings are all divided and the classes segregated by departments.</p>

<p>The departments themselves are subdivided. Goods are classified,
and each class placed in special compartments. Goods most
frequently called for are near at hand on shelves where they can be
easily reached. Top shelves, space under counters, and other inaccessible
corners are reserved for goods called for less frequently.</p>

<h3 class="p2">THE COMMITTEE SYSTEM</h3>

<p><b>28.</b> We have already referred to the necessity of coöperation in
every successful organization. We do not wish to be understood as
advancing this idea of coöperation for the benefit only of executive
officers and heads of departments. It must extend farther than this&mdash;it
must penetrate to every nook and corner of the shop.</p>

<p>We must have the coöperation of every workman, no matter
how obscure his position, and to secure this coöperation it is necessary
to instill in him an interest in the welfare of the business as a
whole. Treat him as a mere cog in the wheel and he will very likely
be content to do as little work as possible and still draw his pay, with
no thought of bettering conditions in his department. But show him
that you recognize his ability&mdash;that you know that he knows how his
work should be done&mdash;and he will readily lend his coöperation.
The problem of securing this coöperation has been given much
study, and those who have met with the greatest success have done
so by showing the workman that his advice and suggestions are
appreciated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>No matter how willing you may be to receive them, the workman
naturally hesitates to make suggestions personally. But give
him an opportunity to discuss a point with others of his kind and it
is surprising how many practical ideas will be brought out. Experience
has shown that this spirit of working for the good of the
business can best be maintained through the formation of standing
committees. Such committees bring out the best ideas of the men
composing them, and invariably work for the good of the business.</p>

<p><b>29. General Factory Committee.</b> In the manufacturing branch
of a business, the first committee to be formed is the general factory
committee. This committee is usually composed of the superintendent,
who acts as chairman, the chief engineer or designer, the
tool room foreman, or the special designer of tools, the head of the
cost department, and two or three foremen of the most important
departments.</p>

<p>The work of this and all other committees must necessarily be
adapted to the requirements of the business, but, as a general proposition,
the matters to come before the committee may be stated as
follows:</p>

<table id="t02" summary="t02">

 <tr>
  <td class="tdch">1.</td>
  <td class="tdlp2">Reports and discussions of the standardization of the product.</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td class="tdch">2.</td>
  <td class="tdlp2">Reports of progress on new designs or the redesigning of old product
which has been authorized at previous meetings.</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td class="tdch">3.</td>
  <td class="tdlp2">Discussion of economies in general operating methods, economies
in cost of production, and all questions of a similar nature.</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td class="tdch">4.</td>
  <td class="tdlp2">A report on routine work in the factory&mdash;whether stock or special
contracts&mdash;condition of orders, and condition of stock to fill future
orders.</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td class="tdch">5.</td>
  <td class="tdlp2">The question of promotions. If all promotions in the shop are
brought before this committee for approval, it will do away with
the charge of favoritism of foremen in advancing relatives or personal
friends without regard to their qualifications. A foreman
who is obliged to recommend promotions to this committee, will be
very careful that the promotion is deserved.</td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p class="p1"><b>30. Departmental Factory Committees.</b> Many factories manufacture
more than one line of goods. In such factories it is advisable
to have committees to discuss progress in each specific line. Members
of the factory committee should act as chairmen of these departmental
committees. The committees will be composed of the foremen
interested, the tool room foreman, and the head of the cost
department.</p>

<p>The work of the committee, so far as relates to a particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
department, will be very similar to that of the general factory committee.
The discussion will cover:</p>

<table id="t03" summary="t03">

 <tr>
  <td class="tdch">1.</td>
  <td class="tdlp2">Standardization of product and suggestions for new designs.</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td class="tdch">2.</td>
  <td class="tdlp2">Progress on improvements already started.</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td class="tdch">3.</td>
  <td class="tdlp2">Economies in operating expense and cost of production.</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td class="tdch">4.</td>
  <td class="tdlp2">Reports on routine work.</td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p class="p1"><b>31. Job Bosses.</b> Carrying the committee plan a step farther,
it is well to hold occasional meetings of the job bosses. The foreman
of each shop will act as chairman and discuss matters pertaining to
work in his own shop with the job bosses under him.</p>

<p>In most factories it is also advisable to hold, at least once a month,
a general foremen's meeting. This should be a meeting of all foremen,
with the superintendent, for the discussion of problems of a
general nature and problems relating to specific shops.</p>

<p><b>32. Sales Committee.</b> In the commercial branch, perhaps the
most important committee is the sales committee. This committee
should consist of the general manager, who acts as chairman, the
sales manager, advertising manager, chief engineer, and superintendent.
At times it may be advisable to call in the head of the cost
department and the tool room foreman.</p>

<p>At the meetings of this committee the following subjects will
come up for discussion:</p>

<table id="t04" summary="t04">

 <tr>
  <td class="tdch">1.</td>
  <td class="tdlp2">General sales report, showing progress of the business as a whole.</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td class="tdch">2.</td>
  <td class="tdlp2">Territorial sales reports, showing sales in each territory. Both of
these reports should exhibit comparisons between the current and
preceding periods.</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td class="tdch">3.</td>
  <td class="tdlp2">Reports of sales classified according to the nature of the product,
or specific lines of goods. This is in some respects the most important
of the reports, since it shows which are the fast and which the
slow moving lines.</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td class="tdch">4.</td>
  <td class="tdlp2">Suggestions for and a discussion of proposed improvements in the
present products.</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td class="tdch">5.</td>
  <td class="tdlp2">Discussion of proposed new product.</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td class="tdch">6.</td>
  <td class="tdlp2">Standardization.</td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p class="p1">In the discussion of the three last named subjects the engineer
and superintendent are especially interested, and it is here that the
presence of the cost clerk or the tool-room foreman will be required.
A salesman naturally assumes the attitude of considering his customers'
desires of the greatest importance. Naturally he wants the
factory to manufacture the goods that he can sell. But a discussion
of difficulties to be surmounted, increased costs, and like questions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
will go far toward bringing him into line and convincing him that the
interests of the house lie in his pushing standard goods.</p>

<p><b>33. Advertising Committee.</b> A committee which is to a certain
extent a subdivision of the sales committee is the advertising committee.
The general manager should act as chairman, and will have
with him on the committee the comptroller, advertising manager, and
sales manager.</p>

<p>The work of this committee will be confined to a discussion of:</p>

<table id="t05" summary="t05">

 <tr>
  <td class="tdch">1.</td>
  <td class="tdlp2">Results of past advertising, including periodical, street car, bill-board,
and all other forms.</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td class="tdch">2.</td>
  <td class="tdlp2">Appropriations for current advertising.</td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p class="p1">These advertising reports are very important, for, after sufficient
time to establish an equitable cost basis has elapsed, all future advertising
should be based on the cost of actual sales, giving due consideration
of course to the season of the year, general tendency of the
times, and other factors which might temporarily have a disturbing
influence.</p>

<p><b>34. Organization Committee.</b> Another committee of importance,
which, for convenience, we will call the organization committee,
is one which discusses all questions pertaining to accounting and
record systems. This committee will be headed by the comptroller
and will include the sales manager, advertising manager, credit man,
purchasing agent, and superintendent. Sometimes it will be advisable
to call into the meetings the chief accountant, cost clerk, stores
clerk, and even shop foremen.</p>

<p>As indicated above, the chief work of this committee will be a
discussion of systems. While the comptroller prescribes all systems
of record, reports, statistics, and accounts, he should make no radical
changes without discussing the proposed change with those whose
work will be directly affected.</p>

<p>Many systems, good in theory and which with coöperation
would work out in actual practice, have failed because they were
forced on the business. A systematizer may install a good system
and get it into operation, but unless he has secured the coöperation
of those upon whom its operation will devolve, he will very likely find
that after he leaves there is a gradual disintegration until conditions
are worse than before the change was attempted.</p>

<p>It is seldom that a foreman or a clerk will resent a change if he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
made to feel that he is, in part at least, responsible for the change.
When new systems are introduced in the shop, the foremen are quite
likely to look upon them as a means of checking up their departments&mdash;a
sort of police supervision. The writer has had considerable
experience in the introduction of systems into factories, and has
invariably found that the coöperation of the shop foreman could be
secured by asking for his advice. Before prescribing a form or a
system of records for a department, he has made it a point to discuss
the difficulties with the foreman, always leading the foreman to put
forward what seemed to him the greatest difficulties, and then when
these have been apparently solved, to ask the foreman if he does not
think such and such a plan would work. When dealing with particularly
obstinate foremen he has even gone so far as to suggest a plan
which is plainly impracticable, for the very purpose of leading the
foreman to suggest a practical solution. Needless to say, in such
cases the foreman gives the plan his hearty support, because he has
been made to feel that the importance of his suggestions has been
recognized.</p>

<p><i>Committee Meetings.</i> The frequency of meeting of the committees
herein suggested must be decided by each manufacturer. No
hard-and-fast rules can be laid down, but generally these suggestions
will apply:</p>

<p class="pn20r">
General factory committee, weekly.<br />
Departmental factory committees, once in two weeks.<br />
Job bosses and general foremen's meetings, monthly.<br />
Sales committee, weekly.<br />
Advertising committee, monthly.<br />
Organization committee, monthly.</p>

<p><i>Committee Secretaries.</i> At each committee meeting, a stenographer
should be present to act as secretary. When no record is
kept, discussions are quite likely to be rambling rather than confined
to a specific subject. Then, too, matters which were discussed at the
last meeting have grown hazy, and if a man who is responsible for
putting into operation a given suggestion has failed in his duty, there
is always the chance that no one will think of it at the next meeting
unless he brings it up. If, however, an exact record is kept of these
discussions and full reports are delivered to every member of the committee
before the next meeting, a foreman, or other member, will be
very careful about making statements or promises unless he knows
that they can be fulfilled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>Where possible, it is best to have the same stenographer act as
secretary to all committees, as he will become familiar with their work
and can handle it much more expeditiously.</p>

<h3 class="p2">THE SUGGESTION PLAN</h3>

<p><b>35.</b> In many factories, and even in mercantile establishments,
a modification of the committee idea has been successfully introduced
in the form of what is known as the suggestion plan. This plan consists
in asking for suggestions from all workmen, these suggestions to
pertain to manner of handling their own work, improvements for the
benefit of the business as a whole, safety appliances, sanitary conditions,
and anything that may be of benefit to the business.</p>

<p>While between foremen and heads of departments the committee
plan undoubtedly works to the best advantage, we advocate
the suggestion plan for the rank and file of workmen. Even when
called into a committee meeting, the workman sometimes hesitates
to express his opinions, when if he were permitted to give them in
some other manner he would make many valuable suggestions. The
plan is to place at convenient points boxes with slots cut in the top
in which the suggestions can be placed. Workmen are invited to
write out their suggestions and place them in these boxes. They
may either sign them or give their clock numbers. The latter plan
is sometimes advisable, as it does not reveal the identity of the men
making suggestions. All suggestions are taken up in committee
meeting by the committee directly interested, and a small prize is
given for those suggestions that are put into use. Even so large a
department store as Marshall Field &amp; Co. has found it extremely
profitable to offer $1.00 for each suggestion offered by an employe that
is finally adopted.</p>

<p>Another method is to use autographic registers like the one illustrated
in Fig., 11 on which three copies are made. The original is sent to
the office, the duplicate is retained by the workman, while the triplicate
remains on a roll in the machine. This is removed at the time of the
committee meeting, and any suggestions adopted are posted on a
bulletin board. The workman need not even sign his number, but
can present the duplicate as proof that the suggestion was made by
him.</p>

<p>The introduction of any or all of these committee and suggestion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
plans requires careful study, but when once put into operation they
will prove both successful and of inestimable value to the business.</p>

<h3 class="p2">ORAL ORDERS CAUSE CONFUSION</h3>

<p><b>36.</b> Probably no more prolific source of confusion and misunderstanding
of instructions
is to be
found than in the
habit of giving oral
orders. "I understood
you to say" or "I
thought you meant"
are familiar excuses
offered for a failure to
follow what the one
giving them considered clear and explicit instructions.</p>

<div class="floatleft">

         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 11. Autographic Register<br /> Made by United<br /> Autographic
Register Co.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The absolute necessity of clearly defined authorities that every
man connected with an organization may know from whom he is
to receive orders, is well recognized. When we get above the one-man
business, employes are not left in doubt as to the <i>source</i> of
their orders. Why then should there be left the slightest chance of
misunderstanding as to the <i>nature</i> of their orders?</p>

<p>When we issue orders that are to be executed by someone outside
of our own organization, we are careful that they are in writing. If
an order for goods is placed by telephone or telegraph it is confirmed
in writing, not alone for the legal protection afforded by a valid contract,
but that there may be no confusion or misunderstanding.
When we receive an order we prefer to have it in writing for the same
reasons.</p>

<p>The success of any undertaking is largely dependent on the
proper execution of orders. Surely, orders to be executed within the
organization are of equal importance to those that will be executed
by an outsider, and at least the same care should be exercised in
issuing them. The logical conclusion then is that they should be
given in writing. True, oral instructions are sometimes necessary,
but all orders and instructions of importance should be in writing.</p>

<p>There are many classes of internal orders, depending on the nature
of the business. Among them is a class of inter-departmental communications<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
more in the nature of correspondence than direct orders.
In the harmonious operation of an organization, many requests are
made between departments; general orders affecting all departments
are given by the manager; bulletins are issued by a department
manager to all employes under him&mdash;all of these should be in writing.</p>

<p>As an illustration, take a special order from a customer. A salesman
reports that an order can be secured for certain goods provided
some slight change is made in the design. The sales manager will
communicate with the superintendent about the cost of making the
changes. The question then goes to the general manager for a final
decision. Imagine the chances for argument if these negotiations
are carried on orally, but if in writing, what each man said is on
record and entirely clear.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-063.jpg" width="400" height="282"

         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 12. Blank Used for Interdepartment Correspondence</p>
</div></div>

<p>No elaborate form is needed for these communications, but it
is best to use a form differing from that used in the regular correspondence.
A simple form is shown in Fig. 12. The form should
always show from what department it comes, and, to avoid confusion,
it is an excellent plan to use a distinctive color for each department.</p>

<p>Each department should keep a file of these house communications,
including carbon copies of those issued by them. It is frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
necessary to follow up their requests to secure reasonably
prompt action.</p>

<p>To insure the follow-up, each department should be provided
with a follow-up file or tickler, a file having thirty-one numbered
compartments to represent the days of the month. This same file
can be used for all sorts of memoranda of matters requiring attention
on a future date.</p>

<h3 class="p2">ADVANTAGES OF UNIFORM BLANKS</h3>

<p><b>37.</b> One of the little points in the routine workings of a business
office that is not always given proper consideration is the establishment
of a uniform system of blanks. The blanks used for a given
purpose in one department will be of a certain size and color, while
those used for the same purpose in another department will be radically
different in both size and color. Or blanks of entirely different
classes will be identical in size and color. The result is a miscellaneous
collection of blanks in all sorts of shapes and sizes.</p>

<p>Uniformity in blanks at once establishes a means of identification,
avoids confusion, saves filing space and limits mistakes.</p>

<p>Though we may have given the subject little thought, we have
long been accustomed to uniformity in certain blanks and business
papers. If we have been receiving freight over several railroads the
freight bills of each have been readily distinguished by size, color and
style of printing. Correspondence from our customers is recognized
by the style of the stationery, and orders are distinguished from other
communications of the same concern.</p>

<p>Aside from the question of convenience, there is a certain advertising
value in stationery and blanks with distinctive features. At a
glance we recognize in the morning mail the communications from
certain of our correspondents. We feel sure this envelope contains
a remittance, that one a welcome order, another an invoice of goods
for which we have been waiting; each is recognized by a certain style
of the envelope. At no additional expense we can make our own
stationery distinctive. Letter heads, order blanks, statements, invoices,
remittance blanks will be recognized not by one but by all of
our regular correspondents. They will soon learn to associate our
name with certain styles of stationery.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-065.jpg" width="400" height="272"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">THE LARKIN ADMINISTRATION BUILDING<br />

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>Distinctive stationery does not necessarily mean expensive
stationery. Our advice is, buy the best quality that you feel you can
afford; above all, make it distinctive, make it represent you. Adopt
a color, or style of type, or shade of ink that will make your stationery
stand out from the mass coming to the desk of every business man.</p>

<p>The problem of filing space is a serious one in most offices,
already overcrowded. Filing devices are made in certain sizes that
have become standard. The more closely blanks to be filed conform
to these sizes, the less space will be required. While we cannot
regulate the sizes of the stationery of our correspondents, we can
regulate the size of our blanks that will eventually find their way
into our own files.</p>

<h2 class="p4">ADVERTISING AND SALES ORGANIZATION</h2>

<h3 class="p2">INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p>The purpose of this book is to teach neither the art of advertising
nor the science of salesmanship, but rather to set forth some of
the principles that must be applied in the organization of the advertising
and sales department; in particular, to discuss the machinery
of the department&mdash;its record-keeping systems.</p>

<p>Opinions differ as to the proper place in a business organization
of advertising and sales&mdash;whether they should be handled by, and
considered as, two separate and distinct departmental organizations,
or one. Both plans have their champions.</p>

<p>Whether we call it an <i>advertising</i> or a <i>sales</i> department, the results
sought&mdash;the reasons for the existence of the department&mdash;are the
same. To <i>sell goods</i> is the aim of the organization, be its head an
advertising manager or a sales manager.</p>

<p>Advertising has been defined to be <i>printed salesmanship</i>; yet
there is a well-defined dividing line between the work of the advertising
man and the salesman. The advertising man seeks to impress
the name of the house and the name and quality of its product, on
the public mind; to create interest; to arouse curiosity; to stimulate
desire; to attract people to the store&mdash;in a mercantile business. The
salesman seeks to turn that interest, curiosity, desire, into action&mdash;the
action of purchase.</p>

<p>The advertising man introduces the possible customer; the
salesman makes the sale. But in some businesses, the advertising
man goes one step farther and actually makes the sale&mdash;as in advertising
intended to secure direct orders, by mail. Also, the salesman,
when the customer has been introduced, makes use of other forms
of advertising, to further stimulate desire and assist in making the sale.</p>

<p>No matter at what angle the subject is viewed, it is seen that the
advertising man and the salesman are very dependent on each other.
We prefer, therefore, to consider the sales and advertising departments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
as of equal importance; both subordinate parts of the sales division
but working in perfect harmony.</p>

<p>The salesman knows his goods, their strong and weak points,
the classes of people to whom they will appeal. He should know,
also, all about his competitor's goods, and in what respects they are
excelled by his own. In short, he is the one who can give the best
selling points to the advertising man.</p>

<p>The advertising man is expected to be a master of expression.
The unpolished selling points of the salesman are worked over by
the advertising man into clear, pointed, convincing English&mdash;printed
salesmanship. His experience tells him how best to reach a given
class; what methods of advertising are best suited for a particular
class of goods.</p>

<p>When a selling campaign is contemplated, the plans should be
worked out by the salesman and the advertising man. The two
must work together and neither should undertake a new campaign,
without first consulting the other.</p>

<p>The claim is sometimes made that the function of advertising
is fulfilled when the inquiry has been received; that it is then a question
of salesmanship&mdash;but where does advertising end and salesmanship
begin? If sales are made by mail, the salesman supplements
his salesmanship with catalogs, booklets, circulars, letters&mdash;all as
surely advertising as salesmanship; in the store, he displays his goods
attractively, which is a most effective form of advertising. And so,
in the battle for business, victories are won by supplementing advertising
with salesmanship, and salesmanship with advertising&mdash;combining
the two for results.</p>

<p>Occasionally, a man is found who combines the creative ability
of the advertising man with the executive ability of the sales manager.
When such a man is found, it is safe to place him in charge of the
sales division, giving him full control of both advertising and sales.
He probably will require the services of a man to attend to the details
of the advertising department, but such an arrangement makes the
sales manager alone responsible.</p>

<p>Most large enterprises, however, require the services of one man
to handle the advertising. For this reason the head of this department
is referred to as the advertising manager, and the department
as an advertising department.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>


<h3 class="p2">SYSTEMS AND RECORDS</h3>

<p>In addition to the technical knowledge of the printing art&mdash;type,
engraving, and paper&mdash;and of advertising media, which the
successful advertising manager requires, he should have the faculty
of applying common-sense system in the handling of his work. An
elaborate system, which oversteps legitimate bounds and enters the
realm of red tape, is to be deplored, but the advertising man must
have a system of records which will show at all times what he is doing,
what results he is getting, exactly where he stands.</p>

<p>Any discussion of systems must be more or less theoretical,
even when written by an experienced advertising man. The system
that works perfectly in one office may fit in no other, therefore the
systems described in this book are to be taken as examples of what
other advertising men have adopted. From them the student will
be able to devise a practical system for a particular enterprise. At
the start, the system probably will be too complicated; experience
alone will tell the advertising manager where to eliminate, where to
simplify, where to add to make it fit.</p>

<p><b>Advertising Information.</b> The advertising manager collects
a vast amount of information for future use. Every time he picks
up a newspaper or magazine his eye scans the pages for ideas, while
mingling with the crowds or walking alone, he notes what would be
to the unobserving but trifling incidents, all of which can be worked
into copy. If he is systematic he clips and makes memoranda of
all this information, preserving it for use when needed.</p>

<p>How to preserve it in such shape that it can be located quickly
is something of a problem. Probably the oldest methods of preserving
clippings and memoranda is to use a scrapbook, and paste
in all clippings. The scrapbook, however, is never satisfactory for
this purpose; it is not a flexible system.</p>

<p>Clippings should be so filed that any single clipping can be
removed without disturbing the others. The vertical file is largely
used as a receptacle for clippings, but is not entirely satisfactory unless
envelopes take the place of folders. With folders, clippings are liable
to be lost through the open ends.</p>

<p>An old and satisfactory method is to file clippings in envelopes.
Unless the clippings are of large size&mdash;like entire pages from trade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
papers&mdash;it is not necessary to use envelopes of a size to fit a vertical
file, A size that will fit one of the smaller files&mdash;about 7"×9"&mdash;will
be found more satisfactory.</p>

<p>The most satisfactory method of indexing is by subject. An
envelope is used for each subject about which clippings are to be made,
all clippings and memoranda being filed in the proper subject envelope.
The envelopes are indexed alphabetically, according to
subjects, and a list of contents should be recorded on the outside of
each envelope. A form of record is shown in Fig. 1, while Fig. 2
shows the manner of filing and indexing.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center"> Fig. 1. Special Box Envelope for Clippings and Advertising Copy</p>
</div></div>

<p>Clippings are made use of by the advertising man chiefly in the
preparation of copy, and are much more convenient to handle if filed
in envelopes than when pasted in scrapbooks. Instead of an unwieldy
book to handle, an envelope is taken from the file and the desired
clipping selected.</p>

<p>Sometimes the work of the advertising man is of a nature which
requires the preservation of catalogs, booklets, and all sorts of printed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
matter issued by competitors. When the accumulation of such matter
is sufficient, it is best to install a complete catalog filing system, such
as is used in the purchasing department.</p>

<p><b>Designs and Cuts.</b> A class of valuable property which accumulates
rapidly in an advertising department, consists of advertising
designs and cuts. This property is not given the care deserved when
its value is considered.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-073.jpg" width="400" height="340"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 2. File Drawer Showing How Clippings are Filed by Subject</p>
</div></div>

<p>Artists are paid for designs but too often after the engravings are
made, they are stored in drawers, on shelves, or in any convenient
place to get them out of the way. Little attempt is made to so file
and index them that each can be quickly located.</p>

<p>An old design may be available for use at any time&mdash;an engraving
of different size than the original, may be needed, or a slight alteration
may produce a complete change in the design at much less cost
than making a new one. Engravings are expensive and accumulate
with amazing rapidity. Suppose a retailer does daily advertising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
and uses a new cut each day; at the end of one year he owns
three hundred and sixty-five original engravings, and probably an
equal number of electrotypes. Any of these may be available for
use another time, either in newspapers, catalogs, or circulars.</p>

<p>The national advertiser, using magazines and trade papers,
may accumulate a less number of engravings than the retailer, but
owing to the class of engraving required and the number of duplicates
needed, his investment is even greater.</p>

<div class="floatleft">
     <img src="images/ill-074.jpg" width="250" height="159"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 3. Box File for Drawings<br /> and Photographs</p>
</div></div>

<p>The natural supposition would be that advertisers would give
this property proper care, filing under correct classifications, indexed
for ready reference. But experience proves the contrary. Every
printing and
publishing office
that has been
running five
years has an
accumulation of
cuts belonging to
advertisers,
which represent
an investment of
thousands of dollars.</p>

<p>Occasionally
an advertiser is
found who knows exactly where each cut has been sent and calls
for it when needed, but a big majority of these cuts are never called
for and finally are sold by the printer for what they will bring, as
old metal.</p>

<p>Now the property used by the advertising department should
receive the same care as any other; a dollar invested in designs and
engravings should be regarded as a dollar's worth. And if common
sense be applied in devising a system, they can be cared for with as
little trouble as any other property carried in stock.</p>

<p>A very satisfactory method of filing designs is to use a file constructed
on the principle of the vertical file. Stock sizes of files are
too small. Designs cannot be folded and the file should be large
enough to take in the largest designs used. An elaborate file is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
necessary; a box constructed along the lines of the one shown in Fig.
3, will answer the purpose. The chief requirements are to have the
designs filed in one place, where they can be found, and to keep them
clean. Any carpenter can build such a file, while any cabinet man
will construct one of more elaborate design to match the furniture
of the office.</p>

<p>Designs may be filed alphabetically by subjects, or numbered
and filed numerically. As a rule, the alphabetical method will be
found more satisfactory.</p>

<p>Engravings are best filed in a cut cabinet of the usual style.
This is a cabinet of shallow drawers, just deep enough to hold type-high
cuts. All engravings should be numbered and electrotypes
stamped with the same numbers as the originals. The cuts can then
be filed by numbers, and each drawer labeled to show the numbers
of the cuts it contains.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-075.jpg" width="400" height="248"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 4. Loose-leaf Scrap Book Sheet for Preserving Proofs of Engravings</p>
</div></div>

<p>Cuts should be numbered consecutively, and when an engraving
is made in a new size it will take the next number, regardless of the
fact that an engraving of the same design has already been made.
For instance, if five sizes of engravings are made from one design,
there will be five cut numbers. When the cut is numbered, it is a
good plan to stamp the number on the back of the design; then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
reference to the design will show how many times it has been engraved
and the numbers of the cuts.</p>

<p>Proofs of all engravings should be kept. These may be pasted
in scrapbooks, but the books should be loose leaf. This makes it
possible to eliminate all dead matter; when designs are of no further
use, the sheets containing the proofs can be destroyed.</p>

<p>A sheet may contain proofs of one or of several cuts, depending
on the size, but all proofs should be arranged in numerical sequence.
The sheet should also show the cut number, the subject, and the
date of ordering electrotypes, as shown in Fig. 4. Since the space
required for proofs cannot be told in advance, it is more practical
to substitute a rubber stamp impression for printing. By using a
small stamp, this information can be stamped opposite each proof.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 5. Index Card for a Record of Designs and Engravings</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>Cut Indexes and Tracers.</b> To complete the filing system for
cuts and designs, an index is needed. Fig. 5 shows a convenient
form of index and record card. This card is headed with the name
or subject of the design, and is indexed under this subject. The
data relative to the design includes the class&mdash;as photograph, wash
drawing, or line drawing&mdash;the name of the artist, the size of the
design, and the date made. Below this is a complete record of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
original engravings and electrotypes made from the design, including
their numbers.</p>

<p>On the back of the card is a record of the publications, catalogs,
or circulars in which the design is used, with dates, as shown in Fig. 6.</p>

<p>If the name of the artist who made a certain design, or the names
of publications in which it has been used, is wanted, reference to this
card gives the desired information. This one card provides all
information that is likely to be needed in reference to both designs
and engravings.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 6. Reverse of Index Card Showing Where Engravings are Used</p>
</div></div>

<p>The methods described provide for a complete record of designs
and engravings, except in respect to cuts which have been sent out.
A record of the cuts that are out, and where each has been sent, is
of the utmost importance.</p>

<p>When a cut is sent out&mdash;to the printer, the publisher, or a customer&mdash;a
receipt should be obtained. This may be on a post card
printed as shown in Fig. 7. At the same time a record to be used
as a tracer should be made. This should be on a form similar
to the one shown in Fig. 8. These forms may be filed in a tickler
under the date on which the cut should be returned, or alphabetically;
but in either case a desk file should be used so that they can be referred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
to very readily. This file should be looked through frequently
for it is very necessary to follow-up the cuts closely. If the cut is
not expected to be returned,
it is of course
unnecessary to make this
tracer record.</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>Copy Proofs.</b> A complete
file of proofs of all
copy is a necessity in
every advertising department.
If requested to
do so, any publisher will
furnish several proofs of
the ad, and at least three
proofs should be kept on
file. Every piece of copy
and every circular or
other printed matter
should bear an identifying
mark of some kind.
This usually is a number.</p>

<p>These numbers should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
be registered consecutively either in a book or on cards, and
opposite each number should be the title of the copy, booklet, or
catalog. It is well to run different series of numbers for advertising
copy and other literature. Numbers 1 to 5,000 might be used for
copy, and 5,001 to 10,000 for printed matter. The same scheme can
be used to good advantage for office blanks of all kinds, giving each
a form number but using a third series of numbers.</p>

<p>Proofs of ads and copies of all printed matter and blanks should
be filed alphabetically by subject or title. For proofs, the envelope
scheme, as described for clippings, can be used. Envelopes of this
size&mdash;7"×9"&mdash;will also accommodate copies of most circulars,
blanks, and booklets, but if the sizes average larger a vertical file
drawer, with large envelopes, can be used. The vertical file will
also accommodate catalogs. These files being permanent, the expense
of elaborate cabinets can be dispensed with by substituting
the cheaper transfer files supplied by all manufacturers of such
equipment.</p>

<p>Each time a piece of advertising copy is re-set in a different size,
it should be given a new number. New numbers should also be
given each circular, booklet, or blank when it is re-printed, provided
there is the slightest change in the copy.</p>

<p>On each envelope, the copy number should be entered, and if
the copy takes several numbers, all should be entered. Copy bearing
the title "Your Chance" may be set in three sizes&mdash;full page,
No. 640; half page, No. 641; and quarter page, No. 645; all proofs
will be filed in one envelope and the three numbers will be entered
on the outside.</p>

<p>The register of numbers and the file of proofs provide for the
identification of any copy; if the title of any piece of copy is wanted,
the number being known, reference to the register gives it; or if the
title is known, reference to the file gives the number.</p>

<h3 class="p2">PRINTING ORDERS AND TRACERS</h3>

<p>Great care is necessary in issuing and following up orders for
printing; every detail must be watched closely if satisfactory results
are to be secured. In the majority of offices the advertising manager,
or a man under him, attends to all details of ordering printing. Large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
concerns find that it pays to employ an experienced man for this
work alone. To a concern whose printing bills amount to several
hundred dollars a month, a man who will give close attention to every
detail of the work, from seeing that he gets the stock specified to
checking bills for overcharges, can make his services worth a good
salary.</p>

<p>In printing, as in everything else, the personality of the house
should stand out&mdash;a typographical style should be established. This
is accomplished much more quickly if every detail of the printing is
in the hands of one man.</p>

<p>There are concerns in which publicity and sales work must be
subdivided to such an extent that the sales manager has all printed
matter prepared under his direct supervision; while the advertising
manager is responsible for the preparation and placing of the copy.
In one such concern, which has come under the writer's observation,
copy for printing is turned over to a man entirely outside of the sales
division. The theory is that the outside man will watch the interest
of the house, in the matter of price, more closely than the man who
prepares, and perhaps is to use, the copy.</p>

<p>This theory may have some foundation in certain quarters;
probably there are some otherwise competent advertising men who
are occasionally outwitted by the printer; but it is also true that the
buyer of printing, who places his orders on the basis of price alone,
frequently loses more in quality than he saves in cost. The man
who is to use a booklet or folder is really the best judge of its worth&mdash;what
he can <i>afford</i> to pay for the kind of work he wants; he knows
best its possible value as a revenue producer. He should be competent
to supervise the placing of the orders, but without exception
<i>all</i> printing orders should be placed by the same man.</p>

<p>No matter by whom placed, the printing order should specify
every detail; or if it is not on the order blank, there should be a specification
sheet. The specifications would be something like those
shown in the order form, Fig. 9.</p>

<p>This order should be made in triplicate. The original and
duplicate will go to the printer, the duplicate to be signed and returned
as an acknowledgment of the order, while the triplicate is
filed in a tickler under the date when the acknowledgment should be
received&mdash;usually the following day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-081.jpg" width="400" height="627"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 9. Triplicate Form of Order for Printing</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>When the duplicate comes back from the printer it is placed
in the tickler, under the date when proofs may be expected. At the
same time the triplicate is removed from the tickler and placed in a
loose-leaf binder, all copies being filed in numerical sequence. It
will be noted that, at the bottom of the triplicate, the department or
account to be charged is entered, this record being made when the
order is placed.</p>

<p>When proofs are returned, the duplicate is moved ahead to the
promised date of delivery. In this way the follow-up for orders is
made practically automatic, all orders filed under any date being
removed for attention on that day.</p>

<p>Little difficulty is experienced in getting printers to put the order
number on the invoice, when requested to do so. The return of two
or three invoices to a printer who neglects this will have the desired
effect. With the numbers on the invoices it is a very simple matter
to find the copy of the order, which will show just what was ordered
and for what department.</p>

<p><b>Records of Printing.</b> A record of all printed matter received
and its disposition is quite as important as for any other class of
property. Unless properly stored and correctly recorded, there is
likely to be a great waste of stock. Many large concerns lose much
more through waste in this direction than the salary of a competent
stock clerk. Not all concerns will require a stock clerk for this purpose
alone, but in every office the stock of printed matter should be
placed in charge of one person&mdash;a clerk, perhaps, who has other
duties. That person should be made responsible for the stock, just
as the stores clerk is made responsible for the property in the factory
storeroom.</p>

<p>When printing is received, it should be first checked against the
order copy on file, and then put in the storeroom, or sent to the department
where it is to be used if not to go into stock. In the storage
of printing, a very necessary requirement is that it be kept clean,
otherwise, in the case of matter carried in stock for a long period,
there may be as much as a ten per cent loss through spoilage.</p>

<p>It is best to have all printing put up in packages of specified sizes,
depending on the quantities used. The printer will usually make
the size of his packages fit the needs of the customer, if requested to
do so. On the outside of each package, the name and quantity of
the contents should be recorded. When possible a sample should
be attached.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>An extensive advertiser will require a good-sized room for the
storage of printing, while for some concerns a small cabinet will
answer the purpose. In storing, the packages should be arranged
according to name, maintaining the alphabetical order so far as
possible. A numerical arrangement, by form numbers, is sometimes
recommended, but any filing scheme which makes it necessary to
refer to a supplementary index to find a number before the article
itself can be located is not favored.</p>

<p>A low stock limit should be set for every piece of printing that
is used regularly and likely to be re-ordered. One of the most simple
methods of handling this is to make one package of the quantity set,
so arranging the stock that it will be the last package reached. On
the outside a label is pasted&mdash;or a rubber stamp can be used&mdash;printed
as follows:</p>

<p class="p15r">This package must not be opened without
first notifying the office. Failure to
observe this rule will be considered sufficient
cause for instant dismissal.</p>

<p>After the storage plan has been arranged then comes the question
of stock records. A simple record which will show quantities received,
issued, and on hand is needed. The form shown in Fig. 10
is used by a manufacturer who supplies dealers, who are his customers,
with catalogs, booklets, and other forms of printing. The same form
is adapted for use by a concern selling through branches or agencies,
while for another business, the form would be modified, eliminating
records of shipments.</p>

<p>This form is printed on a sheet punched for a loose-leaf binder.
A sheet is used for each catalog, folder, booklet, circular, mailing
card, or other piece of printing, the name being written at the top of
the sheet. The sheets are filed in alphabetical order, indexed with
suitably tabbed index sheets.</p>

<p>When printing is received and the order checked, the name and
description is entered at the head of one of these sheets&mdash;except in
the case of a re-order, when a sheet will be found in the binder.
The date, quantity, from whom received, and the cost are next recorded
in the proper columns. If it is a new piece of printed matter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
the quantity received is also entered in the <i>on hand</i> column; if a
reprint, the quantity is added to the stock on hand and the total
extended.</p>

<p>For printing that is to be sent to a dealer, an order is entered on
the form shown in Fig. 11. This gives detailed instructions for
shipping, with the quantity and description of the matter to be sent.
The order is made in duplicate. The original goes to the shipping
clerk, while the duplicate, on a blank sheet, is kept in the office as
a follow-up on the shipping clerk.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-087.jpg" width="400" height="246"

         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 11. Shipping Order for Printing to be Sent to a Dealer</p>
</div></div>

<p>As shipments are made, the shipping clerk enters in the columns
provided for that purpose, the quantity sent and the date. When
the entire order is filled, it is returned to the office. Every day the
duplicates are examined and inquiry is made of the shipping clerk
regarding any orders for which the originals have not been returned.
When the original is received, the duplicate is destroyed.</p>

<p>Shipments are next entered on the stock sheets, while the original
orders are filed in a binder, alphabetically by dealers names. Reference
to this file shows exactly what advertising matter has been sent
each dealer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="p2">PERIODICAL ADVERTISING</h3>

<p>When the question of periodical advertising is taken up, the most
important of all publicity fields is entered. From the country weekly,
through the entire list of city dailies, scientific and literary weeklies
and monthlies, popular magazines, class magazines, and trade papers
for every vocation, religious papers, and reviews, periodicals can be
selected which will reach any class or cover any territory. With the
thousands of publications to select from, the advertising manager
needs to know which ones will best reach the people he wants to
reach; what papers have the largest circulations; which are most
popular among a given class or in a certain territory. He must be
posted on rates and discounts, that he may cover his territory economically.
And added to this, he must have a perfect checking system,
that he may know to a certainty what returns each and every publication
is bringing him. Such a system may show him, for example,
that the magazine with a circulation of a million and an advertising
rate of $5.00 a line, brings orders at a less cost than another in which
he is paying but $2.00 a line&mdash;or <i>vice versâ</i>. Perhaps the cost in
both is within the amount he is prepared to pay, but he must <i>know</i>
what it costs, that he may know where to increase and where to curtail
the appropriations.</p>

<p><b>Rate Cards.</b> Supposing the business to have been just started,
or one that has done no advertising&mdash;and this is the most satisfactory
premise from which to work, in laying out a general system for the
department&mdash;among the first duties of the advertising manager will
be to secure information about mediums, and the chief source of information
will be the publications themselves, as they will respond
promptly to requests for rate cards.</p>

<p>If the advertising manager gets rate cards from a hundred publications,
he will find probably forty or fifty different shapes, sizes, and
styles. Several spasmodic attempts have been made to induce publishers
to adopt a uniform size for rate cards, with but little success.
In the effort to produce something striking, the convenience of the
advertiser is very likely to be overlooked. One publisher will use
a 3"×5" card&mdash;the most convenient size; another, in order to better
display the artistic ideas of his own copy department, uses a card<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
6"×9"; a book of rules is issued by another; the result is a miscellaneous
collection that does not fit any size of file made.</p>

<p>To insure uniformity in their files, advertising agencies have
been obliged to design rate sheets or cards which they send to the
publisher to be filled in. Some large advertisers now follow the
same plan, requesting publishers to enter rates on special forms.</p>

<p>But whether or not he uses a special form, every advertiser should
have his own file of rate cards&mdash;even if the information is written on
a blank card. The special information needed is shown in Fig. 12.
This can be on a card, or if preferred, a sheet to be filed in a loose-lea
binder can be used. The cards or sheets should be indexed alphabetically,
under the names of the publications.</p>

</div></div>

<p>If full and satisfactory information is not obtained from the
publishers, it is well to supplement it with information from an advertising
agency. The successful agency, through observation on
behalf of a number of clients, usually has more dependable information
about a given publication than can be obtained by any one
advertiser.</p>

<p>All sources of information should be made use of; if the article
advertised is sold to the trade, much valuable information can be
secured from local dealers. In planning a daily paper campaign
for a certain commodity, a letter was sent to each dealer contiguous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
to each city asking what morning and evening papers had the largest
sale in his town; at what hour each was received; and the general
trend of local political sentiment. This brought a gratifying response,
and helped in the selection of papers which covered, not only the
cities, but the small towns. Another advertiser secured some very
satisfactory reports from his traveling salesmen, relative to the value
of local papers in which he contemplated advertising.</p>

<p><b>Advertising Contracts.</b> Contracts for advertising are usually
made once a year, in advance. Most publishers of magazines and
newspapers grant certain space discounts, based on the space used
within one year, and in many cases, to secure these discounts, contracts
must be made in advance. Some trade paper publishers allow
space discounts, others maintain flat rates, all of which must be considered
in making contracts.</p>

<p>Practically all magazines, most newspapers, and some trade
papers, allow special discounts or commissions to advertising agencies&mdash;though
in the case of newspapers, in many cities, this discount
applies only to <i>foreign</i> advertising, or that originating outside of the
city of publication.</p>

<p>An increasing number of advertisers are placing contracts for
space through the agencies, and relying largely on the advice of the
agency in the selection of mediums. Since the business of the largest
and most successful advertisers is placed through the agencies, it
would seem to be a safe rule to follow. But because an agency
handles the orders, the shrewd advertising manager will not relax
in his watchfulness of his employer's interests. He will maintain
just as complete a rate file, and watch the bills as closely as though
dealing direct with publishers.</p>

<p>The experienced advertiser plans his campaigns well in advance,
making annual appropriations for all advertising. This enables
the advertising manager to select mediums, determine the amount
to be used in each class, and prepare suitable copy for the different
publications.</p>

<p>This question of the preparation of copy for series of ads applies
especially to national campaigns and local advertising of a general
publicity nature. The advertising manager of a department store
is obliged to prepare newspaper copy daily, and at best can plan his
copy not more than two or three days in advance. In a national<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
campaign in which advertising is for direct returns, copy must be
<i>tried out</i> and its character changed frequently. This does not mean
that, in any case, the same copy should be run indefinitely; it should
be changed in practically every issue. While following the general
style adopted for the house, there should be something new in every
issue&mdash;something that will attract and cause the reader to look for
the ad each month.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 13. Schedule of Monthly Insertions in Periodicals</p>
</div></div>

<p>When the amount of the appropriation has been decided, a
schedule of the mediums to be used should be made. This schedule
should include the space to be used in each publication. Indeed,
the schedule of mediums and space that it is desired to use, often
determines the appropriation. For a general publicity campaign,
this schedule can be made absolute, but when the advertising is for
direct returns, it should be elastic. Mediums which do not pay after
a fair trial, should be dropped, and there should be room in the
schedule for mediums not at first included. Changed conditions
may make it advisable to add a medium which previously has been
unprofitable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>The advertiser who advertises for direct inquiries or orders,
usually finds it necessary to revise his schedule monthly, basing each
schedule on previous results. That he may act intelligently, he must
have an exact record of past results. A convenient form for the
monthly schedule is shown in Fig. 13, which is printed on a sheet
punched for filing in a loose-leaf binder.</p>

<p>Previous results from each publication on each class of goods
is shown in respect to inquires, amount of sales, and cost of the advertising.
In the three columns at the right of the space for each ad,
cost of each, and total cost are shown.</p>

<p>Separate sheets are used for popular magazines, trade papers,
and newspapers. When copy has been sent, the sheets are placed in
a loose-leaf binder, the full schedule for each month being in one place
where it can be readily referred to.</p>

<p><b>Orders for Insertion.</b> When an agency is employed, the agency
usually sends copy and orders for insertion to the publisher; though
some advertisers prefer to send copy direct, leaving the agency to
send orders for insertion. It usually happens, too, that some orders
are sent direct instead of through the agency. One large advertiser
follows the practice of sending orders direct to those publishers who
do not allow agency commissions, all others going through the
agency.</p>

<p>If orders are to be sent direct, a special advertising order blank
should be provided. This order should specify to the last detail the
conditions of the order. A blank, which is self-explanatory, is shown
in Fig. 14. The order is made in duplicate and the copy is filed under
the name of the publication.</p>

<p><b>Checking Returns.</b> A necessity to the advertising department
is an efficient system of checking and recording returns from advertising.
Without a checking system on which he can depend, the
advertising manager is spending his employer's money blindly&mdash;he
does not know what he is getting for it.</p>

<p>The first requirement in devising a system is a method of <i>keying</i>
ads, that inquiries or orders may be identified and credited to the
proper mediums. Keying systems there are without number&mdash;to
describe all of them would require a book the size of this one&mdash;but
those most commonly used are adaptations in one form or another,
of the idea of changing the address.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 15. Card Used for a Record of Inquiries from a Given Publication</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the oldest methods is to use a department number or
letter in the address, changing the number in each publication in
which the ad appears&mdash;the address in one would be <i>Dept. A</i>; in another,
<i>Dept. B</i>. This method is used successfully by some advertisers,
but it has its objections. Most people realize that no concern is so
large that an inquiry will not reach the proper department. If, for
example, an inquiry in response to a beef extract ad, addressed to
Swift &amp; Co., failed to reach the beef extract department, it would
indicate a very lax system of handling correspondence.</p>

<p>Changing street numbers, room numbers, or postoffice box
numbers, is another common method of keying. This can be operated
successfully by notifying the local postal authorities that all mail is
to be delivered at one number, regardless of the address.</p>

<p>An adaptation of the number key, which can be used to advantage
for a small number of publications, is a combination of numbers
representing publications and dates. First, the publications are
numbered, these numbers being used as the first part of the address.
To the publication number is added the number of the month or week
of publication. To illustrate:</p>

<p class="p15r">Suppose that the Technical World is
No. 5 on the list and the ad is run in
October. The key number would be
510&mdash;5 standing for the publication and 10
for the month. All replies with that address
would be credited to the Technical
World for October.</p>

<p>In using this system it is necessary to use some figure&mdash;usually
0&mdash;for a repeater to avoid confusion; No. 112 might mean publication
No. 1, month No. 12, or publication No. 11, month No. 2. By
adding a naught after the publication No., confusion is avoided&mdash;1102
would mean No. 11, 2nd month, 10012 would indicate No. 10,
12th month. The system can be further varied by using N., S., E.,
and W., or by substituting Ave. for St. or <i>vice versâ</i>.</p>

<p>When readers are requested to ask for catalogs or other printed
matter, the numbers by which these are known to the reader can be
used for the key&mdash;as bulletin <i>A</i>, bulletin <i>B</i>, etc.</p>

<p>For either direct inquiries or orders one of the most popular
and satisfactory keying systems is to use a coupon, indicating the
publication and month in the coupon&mdash;<i>T W 11</i> printed in small
type in the coupon would mean Technical World for November.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-096.jpg" width="400" height="236"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 16. Reverse of Checking Card Used for a Record of Sales</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>A coupon to be filled in offers the reader a convenient means of
answering the ad, and this has a tendency to induce a larger number
of replies. Few people will fail to use the coupon or the address
given. A certain very large advertiser, who uses the coupon, states
that less than one per cent of his replies are without means of identification;
either the coupon is used or the name of the magazine is mentioned.</p>

<p>To make their checking systems as nearly perfect as possible,
some advertisers write to all readers who fail to use the key, requesting
them to state where the ad was seen. Some enclose a postal for
the reply, others enclose a printed slip, on which the magazines used
are listed, to be checked and returned.</p>

<p>A reasonable expense is justified to find out where replies do
come from, for it is as much to the advertiser's interest to continue
the use of all profitable mediums as to drop the unprofitable ones.
Many of the most successful advertisers, however, consider it safe
to distribute unidentified replies pro rata, basing the distribution on
the number of keyed replies&mdash;that is, if 30 per cent of all keyed replies
can be traced to the Technical World, that magazine will be credited
with 30 per cent of all unidentified replies.</p>

<p>When the mail is opened all replies should be sorted by key
numbers, inquiries and orders separated. Then the total number
of inquiries, and number and amount of orders from each publication
should be ascertained and credited.</p>

<p>For recording credits a form, similar to the one shown in Fig. 15,
should be used. This may be on a card or in loose leaf. A card is
used for each ad, in each publication&mdash;that is, if there are seven
insertions in the Technical World in one year, seven record cards
will be used&mdash;one for each insertion. These cards or sheets are to
be filed under the names of the publications.</p>

<p>On the back of the card the form shown in Fig. 16, is printed.
This provides for a daily record of sales resulting from the inquiries
recorded on the face, or from the ad if it calls for direct orders. These
forms supply all necessary data for a complete statistical record for
each publication. Too much time would be required to look through
all of these cards every time information is desired about a given publication;
a more condensed record of total results should be provided.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>


<p>All of the information of practical value can be combined with
a record of insertions on the form shown in Fig. 17, using a sheet for
each publication. The record includes the date of order, space, subject,
copy No., cut No., dates of insertion, checking, and proofreading,
the date and amount of bill, and the number, amount, and average
cost of sales. The record of sales should be entered monthly from
the detail record.</p>

</div></div>

<p>These sheets are filed in a loose-leaf binder, indexed alphabetically
under the names of the publications. One sheet will accommodate
the full yearly schedule for a monthly or weekly publication.</p>

<p><i>Retail Advertising Returns.</i> To check returns from retail advertising
is quite a different problem from checking returns from
keyed ads in monthly magazines. There are no keys, and no mail
inquiries to be traced. But a record of general results is very desirable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
and it is possible to obtain records which will, at least, indicate
the increase in sales due to advertising.</p>

<p>Results of retail advertising must be measured by comparison;
if a department store advertises handkerchiefs as a leader for Tuesday,
<i>all</i> handkerchief sales for that day would not be due to the advertising,
but it is legitimate to credit advertising with any increase over
normal sales. If correct sales records are kept, it will be possible to
tell the exact amount of handkerchief sales for that and every other
day in the year.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 19. Detailed Record of the Shipment of Street Car Cards</p>
</div></div>

<p>A close check on returns can also be obtained by requiring each
sales person to put a distinguishing mark of some kind on sales for
advertised articles. Proofs of the day's ads, showing the articles
advertised in the department, should be mounted on cards and hung
in each department, that the sales person may know when advertised
goods are sold. If made large enough, the card can be ruled for a
tally of sales, and each sale of advertised goods tallied.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>There should be an office record showing the results of advertising
for each department. In comparing these records sales alone
cannot be used, for the weather, and unusual events calculated to
increase the crowds in town, must be considered. To-day's sales
of an advertised article, with unfavorable weather conditions, probably
will not equal the sales of the same article one year ago, which was
circus day. If daily records, similar to that provided in the form
shown in Fig. 18, are kept, they will soon become very valuable to
the advertising department of any retail store.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 20. Record of Street Car Contract and Net Costs</p>
</div></div>

<h3 class="p2">STREET CAR ADVERTISING</h3>

<p>Street car advertising is of a general publicity nature. It is
intended, not to secure direct orders, but to influence sales by keeping
the name of a commodity before the public. It is local in its
effects, influencing sales only in the cities in which the cards are used.</p>

<p>Street car advertising is now controlled by a small number of
agencies, who own the space in the cars in the different cities throughout
the country. Through one of these agencies, contracts can be
made for space in street cars in any city in the country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>The rate for street car advertising is based primarily on population,
the <i>circulation</i> consisting of the number of passengers carried.
When the advertiser buys space, he pays for having his card appear
in a specified number of cars, for a stated period. As a rule, the rate
is for monthly periods, with special discounts on yearly contracts,
and cards are changed each month. On certain contracts the agency
will include extra service, without additional cost, by running cards
in a number of extra cars, which are put on during the rush hours.</p>

<p>If desired, the agency will design the copy and print the cards,
making an additional charge for the service. Many street car advertisers
prefer, however, to furnish their own cards. This is probably
the better plan for advertisers who maintain efficient copy departments.</p>

<p>Although this book is not intended to teach the technical details
of the art of preparing copy, it may not be out of place to suggest that
copy for street car cards is in a class by itself. Experienced advertisers
have found that to use wordy arguments on a street car card
is a mistake. The card must catch the eye, for it is expected to arrest
the attention but a moment at best. A picture that tells the story
at a glance, large type, and plenty of color seem to meet with most
favor.</p>

<p>The special records required for street car advertising are simple,
consisting of records of contracts. A form for such a record is shown
in Fig. 19. This can be on a card or loose leaf. The form is headed
with the name of the city and instructions for shipping. Below the
heading, is a monthly record of the copy No., subject of the ad,
size of cards, and other necessary data including the gross and net
cost. On the reverse, Fig. 20, is a detailed record of the contract,
and a record of total costs. These sheets are filed in a binder or in
a card tray, indexed by cities.</p>

<h3 class="p2">OUTDOOR ADVERTISING</h3>

<p>Outdoor advertising is the term used to describe all such forms
of publicity as bill boards, signs, painted or printed posters, etc.
This is strictly general publicity advertising.</p>

<p>Like street car advertising, outdoor advertising is thoroughly
organized, and the sale of space is practically controlled by a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
companies. Local bill posters, who control the boards, or <i>stands</i>,
as they are technically known, have their own national organization
which standardizes the practices of the business, regulates rates, and
insures the advertiser against paying for service that he does not
receive.</p>

<p>Rates for this class of advertising are based on population and
the relative desirability of the location. In a city of 500,000 population,
a stand which 150,000 people pass daily is worth more than
one in another section of the city, which is seen but by 50,000 people.</p>

<p>The advertiser pays for his space on the basis of the number of
stands used, size of posters or signs, relative number of <i>down town
or preferred position</i> stands, and length of service. Rates are figured
for periods of one week, two weeks, one month, and longer.</p>

<p>The records of outdoor advertising are very similar to those of
street car advertising. By changing the column headings of Fig.
19 from cars to <i>stands</i>, the form shown answers every requirement.</p>

<p>No outdoor or street car advertising campaign of national
scope should be undertaken until provision has been made to take
care of the business. The <i>trade</i> must be covered first; when the ad
appears on the boards the goods must be on the dealers' shelves.</p>

<p>Indeed, this is a most important factor in any publicity campaign
intended to create a demand for goods sold through the retailer.
Every possible preparation must be made in advance to secure a wide
distribution so that the consumer attracted by the ad will find it easy
to buy the goods. Making known the name of an article in a locality
where it is not carried in stock, or without telling the consumer where
it can be bought, can result in little advantage to the manufacturer.</p>

<h3 class="p2">WHERE ADVERTISING AND SALESMANSHIP MEET</h3>

<p>A very effective method of producing sales&mdash;most largely used
in campaigns intended to secure direct orders, by mail&mdash;is the use of
circulars, booklets, and form letters. This literature is advertising,
but to use it to secure the best results requires the application of a
certain amount of salesmanship. The advertising man may prepare
an attractive piece of printed matter, well-written and containing
convincing arguments, but unless judiciously used, the time and
study put into its preparation is wasted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>A large quantity of such literature, distributed indiscriminately,
would probably bring some business, but the best results are obtainable
only when its use is concentrated; when it is confined to a particular
class and followed up in a systematic manner. Knowing his
goods and the class of people who use them, the salesman is naturally
the best judge of where and when to use those forms of advertising
which he turns into salesmanship by mail. The discussion of
systems of record and methods of use of this form of literature is
taken up under the head of the <i>sales department</i>.</p>

<h3 class="p2">SALES DEPARTMENT</h3>

<p>The sales department proper is in charge of a sales manager,
who has immediate authority over his subordinates and is responsible
for the results secured by his department. No position in the business
organization carries with it greater responsibilities, for on the
sales manager rests the burden of marketing the goods at a profit.</p>

<p>Without entering into a discussion of the science of salesmanship,
the writer takes the liberty of suggesting some necessary qualifications
of a sales manager.</p>

<p>He must be thoroughly imbued with the importance of his work
and have an abiding faith in his ability to get the very best results
out of his department. He must be enthusiastic and capable of imparting
his enthusiasm to others.</p>

<p>He must <i>know</i> the goods, be they pianos or investment bonds.
He must believe in his goods and his house. Unless he feels that his
house is the best on earth and offers goods second to none, he cannot
produce the full measure of results of which he is capable.</p>

<p>He must know the goods of his competitor and what methods
his competitors are using. He must be willing to abandon his own
pet schemes when they fail to produce, or to adopt a new plan, even
though originated by another.</p>

<p>He must be a close student of human nature with the capacity
for judging men. He must be a salesman in every sense else he is in
no position to judge the qualifications of those in his employ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>On the other hand, the sales manager should be given full control
of his department, until he proves to be incompetent. While
other members of the organization will be consulted before a new
campaign is launched, when the plans have been approved he should
be permitted to <i>try them out</i> without interference. Assuming that
he is a competent man in the first place, he will be the first to detect
the weak points and set about to find a way to strengthen them.</p>

<p>Many a sales manager has had his usefulness impaired by the
interference of others before he has had an opportunity to give a
selling plan a fair trial. Selling campaigns have been discontinued
before the turning point was reached, because someone higher in
authority lacked faith; when they would have proved successful, if
carried out as originally planned.</p>

<p>This is not an argument for a stubborn adherence to plans,
regardless of consequence&mdash;any sales committee is liable to make
errors&mdash;but before the campaign is launched the extent to which it
shall be tried out should be decided. If the sales manager is given
an appropriation of $500.00, or $5,000.00, for a trial, he can work
intelligently, but if told to go ahead, and then ordered to stop before
his campaign is well under way, he should not be charged with a
failure.</p>

<p>Another thing that the sales manager should control is the question
of salaries paid to the salesmen. We maintain that the amount
of salary paid to a salesman is of no moment provided he is a profitable
man. A $10,000.00 man who sells goods at a cost of 10% is
more profitable than the $5,000.00 man who sells at 10%, or even
9%, because of the greater volumes of his business. The management
should gauge the sales department by net costs, not by the amount of
individual salaries.</p>

<h3 class="p2">BRANCHES OF SALES DEPARTMENT</h3>

<p>The sales department is logically divided into two branches&mdash;mail
order and personal salesmanship. The mail order branch is
that part of the organization which has to do with the promotion of
sales by mail. The personal salesmanship branch is the division
which makes sales by personal contact with the customer.</p>

<p>The work of the mail order branch is conducted by correspondents&mdash;letter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
salesmen&mdash;assisted by clerks to look after the routine of
the department.</p>

<p>The personal salesmanship branch is conducted, primarily, by
salesmen who visit the customers and personally sell goods. In
many lines, the personal salesmanship branch is supplemented by
agencies, who come in direct contact with the customer.</p>

<p>There are businesses in which the dealers, who carry the goods
in stock, are assisted by both the mail order and personal salesmanship
branches in making the sale to the customer. An example is
the piano business in which inquiries are referred to dealers, the
dealer and prospective customer followed up by mail, and the traveling
salesman sent to assist the dealer to close the sale.</p>

<h3 class="p2">THE MAIL ORDER BRANCH</h3>

<p>When the mail order branch is spoken of it does not refer necessarily
to an exclusive mail order business, but the term is used to
identify the department in any concern which uses the mails to promote
sales. While there are many exclusive mail order houses, employing
no personal salesmen, there are practically no exclusively personal
salesmanship houses. There may be no effort to secure direct orders
in this manner, but the mails are used to influence sales. Extensive
circularizing campaigns are conducted for the purpose of making
known to the consumer the merits of certain commodities, which are
sold only through dealers. In the sense here used, such campaigns
are within the province of the mail order branch.</p>

<p><b>Form Letters.</b> An important factor in the conduct of the mail
order branch, is the use of form letters. In a campaign intended
to secure direct orders, the form letter takes the place of the personal
salesman.</p>

<p>The form letter presupposes a uniformity of conditions. It is
written to appeal to certain desires of the recipient; its arguments
are based on the supposition that the same desire exists in the minds
of all to whom it is sent, and that the same arguments will cause its
readers, as a class, to yield to those desires.</p>

<p>The result of a form letter campaign depends on the extent to
which the letter fulfills its mission in adapting itself to the conditions
of the class to which it is sent&mdash;its adaptability to the mentality and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
environment of its readers. The same argument will not appeal to
the mechanic, farmer, merchant, and banker.</p>

<p>The failure of most form letter campaigns can be traced to one
of two causes&mdash;failure to adapt the letter to existing conditions, or
lack of judgment in selecting a list for a trial. The goods offered
may be used by plumbers and lawyers, but the same letter should
not be expected to <i>pull</i> with both classes. Like the selling talk of
the personal salesman, the letter should be changed for each class.</p>

<p>Other conditions, also, must be studied. Iowa may have harvested
a bumper crop, while Kansas suffers from a drought; mills
in the Pittsburg district may be running overtime, while Buffalo is
in the midst of local labor disturbances. All of these local conditions
influence the results of the letter campaign.</p>

<p>As to lists used for trials, the more usual mistake is in the use of
too small a list. Some sales managers, who have mailing lists of
from 25,000 to 100,000 names, profess to try out a letter with a list
of 300 to 500 names. A list of this size is not sufficient to give an
actual test of the pulling power of any letter. Some of the most
successful letter salesmen give it from their experience that the very
smallest list from which a safe test can be made is 1,000 names.</p>

<p><i>Keying Form Letters.</i> It is just as necessary to <i>key</i> form letters
as to key magazine ads. The key makes it possible to trace results.
The question of keying is most important when a series of letters is
used&mdash;which is true in most campaigns&mdash;for it then becomes necessary
to check the returns from each letter in the series. When one
letter only is sent to a given list, the replies received from that list
can be safely credited to the letter.</p>

<p>There are several methods of keying form letters, among which
are the following: the reader may be requested to address his reply
to a certain department; he may be offered a sample or some novelty;
or the letter may be written in the first person singular so that replies
will naturally be addressed to the writer.</p>

<p>The writer confesses to a preference for the last named method.
The average mail order buyer likes to feel that he is receiving personal
attention&mdash;that there is someone in the house to whom he can
write, instead of addressing the house. A personal touch can be put
into the letter signed by an individual that is impossible in a letter
signed in the name of the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 21. Detailed Record of Form Letters Mailed</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>There are those who contend that only the name of the house
should be used, that the name of an individual should never be signed
to a letter, and who have printed on their letter heads the phrase:
"<i>Address all communications to the company, not to individuals.</i>"</p>

<p>While it is perfectly proper to use every legitimate means to
keep the name of the house before the public, there is a good deal of
senseless fear that the prestige of the house will be usurped by the
individual. In some quarters this fear has resulted in the adoption
of ridiculously extreme rules and regulations. One incident in the
personal experience of the writer will serve to illustrate the point.
Having occasion to request a favor from a certain manufacturer&mdash;a
favor which would be granted, if at all, by the advertising manager&mdash;and
knowing the advertising manager personally, he addressed the
request to him, using his title in connection with the name of the firm.
Somewhat surprising was the following letter, received a few days
later:</p>



<p class="pn15a"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:</p>

<p class="p15rn">We have your favor of the 12th, addressed
to our Mr.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, and your
request will receive the attention of the
proper individual.</p>

<p class="p15rn">Our method of handling correspondence
is such that, to insure proper attention,
all communications should be addressed
to the company. We request
that you observe this rule in the future.</p>

<p class="p35rn">Yours truly,</p>

<p>No more reason for the fear that the house will be injured by
the personality of one of its correspondents can be seen, than that
the personality of the salesman will have greater weight with customers
than the reputation of the house. If the personality of an
employe&mdash;be he a personal salesman or a correspondent&mdash;is worth
anything in a business way, the benefit accrues to the house that employs
him.</p>

<p>There is one other objection to the use of the name of the writer
of the letter, and it comes from the United States Statute making it
a criminal offense to open mail addressed to another. But this
objection can be easily overcome; any employe whose name is used
will sign an order authorizing the opening of letters addressed in his
name, unless marked <i>personal</i>.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Form Letter Records.</i> A copy of each form letter written should
be kept permanently. The copies should be filed in a manner that
will make it easy to refer to them. For this purpose an arch file or
binder is most satisfactory. The letters themselves may be punched
for the file, or the loose-leaf scrapbook idea can be adopted, pasting
several letters on one leaf.</p>

<p>Each letter should be given a number for the purpose of identification,
whether or not it appears on the letter itself. The copies should
be arranged in the file in numerical order, but where there are several
departments or divisions using form letters, they should be divided
by departmental indexes.</p>

<p>It is also well to keep a second copy of the letter with a sample
of the enclosures, as the enclosures may have an important bearing
on the results. These copies may be preserved in the manner suggested
for filing copies of ads and printed matter.</p>

<p>When a form letter is written, a record form, as shown in Fig. 21,
should be started. This may be on a card or loose leaf; the latter is
preferred on account of the larger space for the record. The heading
shows the No. of the letter, the subject, name of the writer, its
No. in the series to which it belongs&mdash;first, second, or third&mdash;the
enclosures, and the names of any special lists used. The body of the
form provides for a record of letters mailed during the year, with a
monthly record of total costs.</p>

<p>The sheets are arranged in the order of letter Nos., in a card file
or a loose-leaf binder.</p>

<p>The reverse of this record form is ruled, as shown in Fig.
22, to provide a record of sales resulting from the use of the letter.
Sales can be entered daily or weekly, but the daily record is recommended.</p>

<p>The methods of obtaining the details for these records is described
later.</p>

<p><b>Follow-up Systems.</b> A necessary and very important factor in
the success of a business transacted through the mails, is the follow-up
system. And in a business in which sales are made by personal
salesmen, the follow-up is used for certain purposes, and is as important
as though used to secure orders.</p>

<p>To follow-up is to keep after, to keep in touch with, and to keep
a certain subject before certain individuals. Whether used to secure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
orders or make collections, the idea of the follow-up is the same,
though it is better known as a system for promoting sales.</p>

<p>The follow-up arises from the same necessity that compels the
personal salesman to call on a prospective customer more than once&mdash;often
many times&mdash;before the first order is secured, and continue
to call to hold his trade. The follow-up simply makes use of letters
and other literature to take the place of the personal salesman.</p>

<p>Mechanically, the follow-up system is a <i>system</i> or <i>method</i> that
insures the sending of the right literature at the right time. Letters&mdash;both
form and special&mdash;catalogs, booklets, folders, circulars, and
mailing cards are all used in the process of following up the prospective
purchaser; the automatic method of showing when each piece
of literature in the series should be sent, is the follow-up system
itself.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-114.jpg" width="400" height="290"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 23. Vertical File Drawer Equipped as a Tickler</p>
</div></div>

<p><i>Tickler Method.</i> The simplest method of handling the follow-up
system is to use a tickler in which to file memoranda or correspondence
by dates. A tickler consists of a file equipped with a set
of indexes numbered from 1 to 31 to represent the days of the month,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
and 12 indexes printed with the name of the month. The monthly
indexes are arranged in order, and the daily indexes are placed in
front of the monthly indexes in numerical sequence. The file may
be a vertical correspondence file, a card tray, or a flat desk file.</p>

<p>In using the tickler for a correspondence follow-up, letters are
filed back of the index representing the day on which the subject is
to receive attention. Each day the letters filed behind that day's
index are removed, and after receiving attention, are filed ahead to
the next follow-up date.</p>

<p>If it is desired to have a letter come up for attention in another
than the current month, the day of the month is noted on the letter,
and it is placed back of the monthly index. On the first of the month,
the index for the previous month is placed at the back of the file,
which brings the current month's index to the front. All papers
that have been filed back of the monthly index are then distributed
by dates. A correspondence file drawer, equipped as a tickler, is
shown in Fig. 23.</p>

<p>For a small amount of correspondence, the use of the tickler is
very satisfactory, and it is also used to excellent advantage for keeping
track of the many matters that require attention at a future date.
A tickler should be included in the equipment of <i>every</i> office, no
matter what the line of business.</p>

<p><i>Card Follow-up.</i> For most extensive follow-up systems, the
card index is used, for the reason that a card is easy to handle, occupies
but little space, and can be adapted to any classification desired. A
card is used for each prospective customer, or name on the list to be
followed up, and should bear the name and address and a brief history
of the efforts made to secure an order, or accomplish the object
of the follow-up.</p>

<p>In operating a follow-up system&mdash;especially if the object is to
sell goods&mdash;the correspondent should have before him a history of
the efforts previously made to secure an order. He should know
what letters and other literature have been mailed just as the personal
salesman knows what arguments he has used. When form letters
have been used it is not necessary to have copies of the letters in each
case, but they should be identified by their numbers, or otherwise.
Records of these letters, by date and number, can be made on a card,
so that the card itself will give the correspondent a complete history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
of the case. The correspondence&mdash;letters from the prospective customer
and copies of special letters to him&mdash;can then be filed in the
regular way, and is accessible at all times.</p>

<p>The oldest method of operating the card follow-up is to use the
tickler index in a card file. The follow-up is operated in exactly the
same manner as described for the correspondence file tickler, except
that the cards are filed ahead instead of the original correspondence.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-116.jpg" width="400" height="236"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 24. Card Used for Follow-up</p>
</div></div>

<p>A typical follow-up card is shown in Fig. 24. At the head of the
card is the name and address of the prospective customer, followed
by the credit rating, the business, and the source from which the name
was obtained&mdash;whether from advertising, a special list, or from a
traveling salesman. The body of the card is ruled for a record of
letters mailed, form and special letters separated. When a letter is
sent the No. and date&mdash;if a form letter&mdash;is entered, and in the file
column is noted the number of days the card is to be filed ahead&mdash;as
10 days or 30 days. If at the time specified, the next form letter
in the series is to be sent, provided no response has been received,
the No. should be noted on the next blank line in the No. column,
so that the letter can be sent by a clerk, without consulting the salesman.</p>

<p>When the cards come from the file, those on which no form letter
is indicated for the next follow-up should be referred to the correspondent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
If he considers a special letter advisable, he should have all
previous correspondence attached to the card, that he may know just
what has been done to land the customer.</p>

<p><b>Cross-Indexing the Chronological File.</b> One of the disadvantages
of the tickler or chronological index, described above, for a follow-up
is the difficulty of locating a card, when the date under which it is
filed is unknown. A letter may be written on June 10, and the card
filed ahead to June 25; on June 16 a reply may be received which
makes it necessary to find the follow-up card, but to do this it is
necessary to look through all of the cards filed between June 16 and
June 25. If the card is not found, the chances are that on the 25th
a regular follow-up form letter, which will make the system appear
ridiculous, will be sent.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-117.jpg" width="400" height="231"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 25. Follow-up Card with Alphabetical Tab</p>
</div></div>

<p>To so file the cards that any one can be found by name, without
interference with the automatic features of the follow-up system,
is an important consideration. This can be accomplished by the
use of a card like the one shown in Fig. 25. It will be noted that this
card bears a small tab or projection, on which is printed the letter <i>B</i>.
These tabs are cut 1/20 of the width of the card and are in twenty
positions across the card. This allows for twenty subdivisions of
the alphabet, the <i>A</i> tab being in the first position, <i>B</i> in the second, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>In filling in a card, one bearing the letter corresponding with
the first letter in the name of the correspondent is selected&mdash;a <i>B</i> card
for Brown, an <i>S</i> card for Smith. Now since <i>B</i> is always printed on
a tab in the second position, and this tab is always the same distance
from the end of the card, when the cards are filed, all <i>B</i> tabs will be
in a straight line from front to back of the drawer.</p>

<p>No matter under what date it is filed, if Brown's card is wanted
it will be found by looking through the row of <i>B</i> tabs in the second
position from the left. Regardless of the number, all tabs printed
with the same letter are found in one row, making it possible to file
cards by date and cross-index by name.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-118.jpg" width="400" height="236"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 26. Follow-up Card with Movable Tab to Show Dates</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>Cross-Indexing the Alphabetical File</b>. An improvement over
the cross-index of the tickler, described above, is the method of cross-indexing
an alphabetical file in a manner to insure a follow-up on a
specified date. A card without tabs, as shown in Fig. 26, is used.
Across the top of the card is printed a series of numbers representing
the days of the month. This may include all of the numbers, from
1 to 31, or the month may be divided into five day periods.</p>

<p>In connection with this card a metal tab, which can be attached
at will, is used. One of these tabs is placed over the number which
represents the date on which it is to be followed up. The card is
then filed, indexed by name.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-120.jpg" width="400" height="260"

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>The numbers being printed in the same position on every
card, all tabs placed over the same number will be in a direct line in
the file. The cards to be removed for the follow-up on a certain date
are those bearing tabs over the number representing that date. On
June 20, for illustration, all cards with tabs over No. 20 are taken
from the file. When letters have been written, the tabs are moved
to the next follow-up date, and the cards returned to the file.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 27. Card for Combined Daily and Monthly Follow-up</p>
</div></div>

<p>This method of cross-indexing with movable tabs permits of
the filing of the cards in any manner desired, with the knowledge
that the follow-up date will be surely indicated. The tab method is
also used for a combination of daily and monthly index. On the
card shown in Fig. 27, the names of the month are printed under the
date. For a follow-up in a later month a colored tab is used to represent
the monthly index, while a black tab represents the day of
the month. To illustrate, we will suppose that the card is placed in
the file on Oct. 5 and the next follow-up date is Nov. 10; a black tab
is placed over No. 10, and a red tab over No. 2. The card will not
be disturbed on Oct. 10, as the red tab indicates that it is to be removed
in a later month, but on Nov. 1, the red tab is removed from
the card, and the black tab will bring it to notice on Nov. 10.</p>

<p><b>Lists of Customers.</b> Every concern whether it secures business
through the mails, by means of personal salesmen, or both, should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
have a list of its customers properly classified and arranged for easy
reference. This should be something more than a list of names and
addresses; certain essential facts about each customer&mdash;such as his
business, the name of the buyer, the credit rating, and amount of
purchases&mdash;should be recorded.</p>

<p>All of this information can be placed at the head of the ledger
sheet, but it never should be necessary for another department to
consult the records of the accounting department for information
needed daily. The information given by the customers' list is of
most value to the sales department and should be kept in that department.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 28. Monthly Record of Purchases of a Customer</p>
</div></div>

<p>For customers' lists, cards are most largely used, and are most
satisfactory. Cards are readily classified, new names can be added
at will, and old names are removed without disturbing the balance of
the list or the general arrangement of the cards.</p>

<p>The follow-up card can be used as a customer's card, but should
be moved from the follow-up to a separate file; or a new card can be
made when a prospect becomes a customer.</p>

<p>On the back of the customer's card a form similar to Fig. 28
should be printed. This is intended for a record of the purchases
of the customer and provides for a monthly record, covering a period
of five years. The amount of purchases is entered monthly from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
ledger. In a business in which the purchases of each customer are
infrequent, each order should be entered with the date, in place of
the monthly summary.</p>

<p><i>Classification of List.</i> The value of a list of customers is greatly
enhanced by a careful classification of the names. Lists of those
engaged in the different trades and professions can be bought, but
no list is so valuable as one made up of the names of those who have
answered your advertisements, or with whom you have done business.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 29. Card File for a Classified Customers' List</p>
</div></div>

<p>Most houses sell goods to those in different trades or occupations.
A manufacturer may sell different lines, or the same line, to jobbers,
retailers, and consumers; a mail order concern may sell to farmers,
mechanics, and small retailers; a retailer may sell to men and women.
To sell each different line to a different class of people, requires
different arguments&mdash;a new line of selling talk must be used in each
case. While the personal salesman has an opportunity to size up
his prospect, and make his argument fit the individual, the letter
salesman must fit his argument to a <i>class</i>. To drive home the right
argument, he must be sure of the class to which his prospect belongs.
He cannot hope to form the personal acquaintance of his prospects,
but must rely on a proper classification.</p>

<p>The classes into which a list of customers and prospects should
be divided depends on the nature of the business and the class of goods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
sold. It might be manufacturers in different lines, the different
professions, retailers in several lines, or all of these combined into
one list.</p>

<p>With a card list, any classification is easily provided. If the
number of classes is small&mdash;not exceeding seven or eight&mdash;the classes
can be indicated by the color of the card, a white card being used for
one class, blue for another, etc.</p>

<p>For a more extensive classification, cards with numbered tabs,
as in Fig. 29, are used. It will be noted that there are twelve of these
tabs, and that they are numbered from left to right. In the follow-up
systems, from which this illustration is taken, each number represents
a certain line of business.</p>

<p>Suppose that No. 1 represents manufacturers; if all manufacturers
on the list are to be circularized, only those names
recorded on cards with the No. 1 tab are addressed. Now if the
business is one dealing in specialties, it may be that the specialty
to be sold will depend on the position held by the prospect&mdash;a sales
manager will be more interested in a book on sales methods than in
one on factory methods. To further classify the list, colors are used.</p>

<p>In the system referred to, eight colors are used. Seven of these
represent occupations of prospective customers, while the eighth is
used for customers. A manager or executive officer is represented
by a blue card, a sales manager by a white card, etc. When a prospect
becomes a customer, the card is removed from the follow-up
file, the amount of the sale is entered on the back, and it is placed in
another file reserved for customers. At the same time a red card is
placed in the follow-up file for use in further circularizing. The tab
on the customer's card shows his business, but the occupation is not
so important since he is already acquainted with the house and its
goods. A more familiar tone can be adopted in letters to a customer,
than to a prospect.</p>

<p>A complete classification, such as provided in this system, is of
immense value to a letter salesman. Suppose he wishes to address
all executives&mdash;the blue card is used; if he wants to reach customers
who are manufacturers, red cards with No. 1 tabs are the ones used.
He can make his letter fit a particular class and be sure of the class.</p>

<p><b>Classification of Sales.</b> There are certain lines of business in
which a second order for the same article is seldom received from any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
customer. An example is the music business. The chances of selling
a customer a second piano are remote, but the fact that he has purchased
a piano is a sure indication that he will be interested in certain
classes of music. Book publishing is another example. A man
who buys a book on advertising, or commercial law, or auditing is
quite likely to be a buyer of other books on the same or kindred

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 30. Card for a Classified Record of Purchases</p>
</div></div>

<p>In a business conducted through the mail, a classified sales list
that shows at a glance what classes of goods have been sold to each
customer furnishes an excellent guide for further circularizing. On
such records it is not necessary to show the amounts of purchases&mdash;the
class is the important item.</p>

<p>Fig. 30 shows a card used for a record of this kind. The goods
are divided into four classes, indicated by the letters at the head of
the columns. When the first sale is made, the name and address
are entered on one of these cards, and the date indicated in the proper
column. A movable tab is placed on the upper edge of the card,
over the letter that indicates the class, and the card is filed. As
subsequent purchases are made the dates are entered, and if the
purchase includes another class of goods, another tab is placed on the
card. In time, one card may bear four tabs, indicating that the
customer has bought goods in all four classes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>When new goods are received, they can be brought to the notice
of those customers whose purchases indicate that they are most likely
to be interested, without disturbing the other cards.</p>

<p><b>Indexing Customers' Cards.</b> The best manner of indexing
customers' and prospects' cards depends on the size of the list. A
list of a few hundred names is best indexed alphabetically. A large
list should be indexed geographically&mdash;according to location.</p>

<p>The geographical index consists of index cards printed with
the names of the states, and sets of indexes bearing the names of
the cities and towns in the different states. The state indexes are
arranged in alphabetical order, and back of these the town indexes
are filed alphabetically. The cards are filed back of the town indexes,
these also being arranged alphabetically. When the number
of names in a city is large, the cards are further subdivided by alphabetical
indexes. In states where the list is small, an alphabetical
index can be substituted for the town index, the letters representing
towns; names of customers in Alton would be filed back of the A
index, those in Springfield, back of the S index.</p>

<p>An advantage of the geographical index is that a definite territory
can be covered by the letter salesman, or the personal salesman
can go over the list and find out the condition of the trade in his own
territory.</p>

<h3 class="p2">PERSONAL SALESMANSHIP DIVISION</h3>

<p>Though the volume of business secured through the medium
of the mails is increasing at a rapid rate, the bulk of the business
of the country is done by personal salesmen.</p>

<p>Leaving out of the discussion the question of retail salesmanship,
the personal salesmanship plan&mdash;the employment of traveling
salesmen&mdash;is the least expensive method of selling goods at wholesale.
To sell certain low-priced specialties to consumers, the mail
order plan is sometimes best, for the reason that it is necessary to
reach a large number of <i>possible</i> buyers to find a few <i>actual</i> buyers.
This can be done at less expense by letters than by traveling salesmen.</p>

<p>More is being learned about how to use the mails to promote
business&mdash;how to make the follow-up system an assistant to the
salesmen. The manufacturer whose goods are sold to the trade,
by salesmen, is learning how to build up his own business by assisting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
the dealer to sell his goods. He advertises to interest the consumer,
he follows up the consumer and the dealer, and in the end
assists his own salesman to sell more goods.</p>

<p>Much good literature has been written on the subject of salesmanship,
plenty of advice about being systematic in his work has
been given the traveling man, but very little has been written on the
subject of making sales records and reports of assistance to both
the house and the salesman. Some suggestions on this phase of the
question are made in this discussion.</p>

<p><b>Routing Salesmen.</b> How to route his salesmen to the best advantage
is one of the important problems of the sales manager.
He must first decide how often the territory should be covered,
then the extent of the territory he will attempt to work, and the number
of men required. When this has been done, the territory of each
man must be laid out, and a route which will enable him to cover
the territory with the smallest mileage, must be selected. The
territory should not be larger than a man can cover in a specified
time, but large enough to require all of his time.</p>

<p><i>Map and Tack System.</i> To know just where each man is at
all times&mdash;to be able to locate Smith or Brown instantly, every day&mdash;is
very necessary. Perhaps the best method of doing this is by the
use of what is known as the <i>map and tack system</i>.</p>

<p>State maps, printed in colors, are fastened in the bottoms of
shallow drawers, a drawer for each state. Sharp pointed tacks,
with heads covered with silk in a great variety of colors, are used
for various classifications, and colored silk cords are used to indicate
routes and territory boundaries.</p>

<p>To each salesman is assigned a specific color, by which he is
always known. Tacks with heads of the proper colors are placed
in the map at the towns on his territory. A cord is then strung
from tack to tack in the order in which he will cover the territory.
When the salesman leaves a town the cord is removed from that
tack, coiled up, and placed over the tack at the next town. The
tack at the end of the cord always shows the present location of the
salesman. Fig. 31 illustrates a map with cords&mdash;represented by the
heavy lines&mdash;indicating salesmen's routes.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>Other tacks, with heads of a different color or coiled wire heads
for holding labels, are used to indicate special facts&mdash;as, competition
strong, customer ready to buy, claim to be adjusted, or collections
to be made. These are placed at the side of the salesman's tacks
and are a reminder to write to him, about the special matter, at that
town. If an inquiry is received or a good prospect developed, in
some small town not regularly visited by any salesman, a special tack
is placed in the map at that point. A cord of special color is then
strung from this tack to the nearest stopping point on any salesman's
route. This is a reminder to write the salesman instructing him to
make a special trip to this point outside of his regular territory.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 32. Traveler's Route Card</p>
</div></div>

<p><i>Route Cards.</i> It is not always advisable to attempt to lay out
the entire route of a salesman in advance, neither is it always possible
for him to make the towns in the time calculated. It is wise, therefore,
to require the salesman to keep the house constantly advised
about his stopping places. When the route is a long one, a route
card, as shown in Fig. 32, should be mailed to the house weekly.
The card should be 3×5 inches in size, to fit the standard size card
drawer. Route cards of all salesmen, whether there are five or fifty,
can then be kept in a card tray in the manager's desk.</p>

<p><b>Reports of Calls.</b> The successful sales manager of the modern
type is learning to get more and more business from his territory;
he is not satisfied to show a large volume of business in a large territory,
unless he feels that he has secured all of the business possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
from every town. If Baker sells two dealers in Peoria, well and good;
but why did he fail to sell the other five dealers in the same line?
And it is not in a fault-finding spirit that he asks <i>why</i>; if he knew why,
perhaps he and the salesman could together work out a plan that
would solve the difficulty and secure from one to five new customers.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-130.jpg" width="400" height="293"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 33. Salesman's Report of Calls in Each Town</p>
</div></div>

<p>The salesman knows better than anyone else why he has failed
to sell certain dealers; he is the man who becomes familiar with the
actual conditions in each town&mdash;what competitors' goods are most
popular, reasons for local business depression such as <i>crop failures</i>
or <i>labor disturbances</i>, and any causes for dissatisfaction with the goods
or business methods of his own house. Possibly the sales manager
is not in a position to change conditions, but certainly, he cannot
solve the difficulties unless he knows what they are. The salesman
should, therefore, assume that there is at least a chance that he will
receive assistance by keeping the house posted on every detail that
might affect his trade.</p>

<p>The only way in which practical results can be secured is for
the salesman to make a report on every call made, in every town on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
his route. A form of report card is shown in Fig. 33. This is intended
for a brief report of calls in one town. Space is provided for
reports of seven calls, but if there is a larger number of dealers,
more than one card is used. On the back of the card, a full line is
allowed to each dealer for remarks.</p>

<p>The salesman is instructed to mail one of these cards, in an
envelope specially provided for the purpose, from each town on his
route. When received, the sales manager examines them, makes
his notations, and files them according to salesmen's routes. When
the salesman is next in the house the sales manager goes over the
cards with him, and they discuss each case individually.</p>

<p>Forms of report cards differ, naturally, according to the business.
In some lines more specific information is needed in each case
to enable the sales manager to judge intelligently the chances for
future business. Fig. 34 represents a card used in one business for
a specific report on each call made. The form shown in Fig. 35
provides for a brief report including suggestions regarding the date
of the next call.</p>

<p><b>Follow-up of Dealers and Salesmen.</b> In the modern advertising
campaigns of manufacturers in many lines, an effort is made
to secure inquiries from consumers, though the goods are sold through
dealers only. The inquiry is usually secured by a promise of a free
sample, a handsome catalog, or other piece of printed matter.</p>

<p>These inquiries should always be referred to the nearest dealer,
and in answering the inquiry, the name and address of the dealer
should be given. In addition to the inquiries received from advertising,
manufacturers in certain lines invite dealers to send them the
names of good prospects. One of the large paint manufacturers
asks the dealer to send two lists&mdash;one of people who are talking of
painting their buildings, one of people whose buildings need painting.
The manufacturer of a widely advertised washing machine asks for
the names of all possible buyers to whom the dealer has talked
washing machines, without making a sale.</p>

<p>The object of all this is to enable the manufacturer to assist the
dealer to sell more goods of his manufacture. Sometimes the margin
of profit to the manufacturer is such that he can afford to maintain
an extensive follow-up on the names, and even send one of his salesmen
to assist the dealer to close the sale.</p>

<p>The manufacturers of one of the popular pianos has secured
excellent results from the operation of such a system. In this system,
the card shown in Fig. 36 is used to follow-up both the inquirer and
the dealer. It will be noted that columns are provided for a record
of the postage on every letter or piece of printed matter mailed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>

The prospect receives a letter once a month, while once in two months
a letter is written to the dealer asking for a report.</p>

<p>With the first letter to the prospect, a postal card acknowledgment
form is enclosed. On the postal, space is provided for names,
which the prospect is asked to fill in with names of friends who might
be interested in pianos. By this simple expedient, an original inquiry
is often added to with a half-dozen new names.</p>

<p>With the first letter to the prospect, there is also enclosed a
formal letter of introduction to the dealer. This letter, which is
addressed to the dealer, reads as follows:</p>

<p class="p15rn">The bearer of this letter wishes to inspect
our pianos. We shall esteem it a
favor if you will kindly explain the merits
of these instruments and give&mdash;&mdash;
&mdash;&mdash;an opportunity to thoroughly
examine them.</p>

<p class="p35rn">Respectfully,</p>

<hr class="dec2" />

<p>At the time of referring the inquiry to the dealer, the blank
shown in Fig. 37 is filled in and mailed to the salesman in whose territory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
the dealer is located. The lower half of the blank is for the
salesman's report to the house.</p>

<p><b>Salesman's Expense Accounts.</b> Detailed expense accounts
should be mailed to the house weekly. A conveniently arranged
form, with columns, for regular expense items such as <i>hotel</i>, <i>R. R.
fare</i>, <i>livery</i>, etc., will greatly assist the salesman in making up his
accounts. Such a form is shown in Fig. 38. This is a card 3"×5"
in size, punched to fit a small ring binder small enough to be carried
in the pocket. Both sides of the card are used, providing for a record
of expenses covering a period of one week.</p>

<h3 class="p2">SALES RECORDS</h3>

<p>Regardless of the nature of the business, whether sales are made
through the mail, by traveling salesmen, or resident agents, summaries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
of sales from day to day, supply much valuable information
to the sales manager. Sales summaries which show the amount of
sales each day and month, are the working charts of the sales manager.</p>

<p>It should be remembered that these statistics are chiefly valuable
for comparative purposes, but to insure comparisons of value, the
statistics must be compiled in proper form. It should be possible
to compare, not alone total sales, but the sales of each man in different
periods, the sales of one man with those of another, the sales in different
territories, the sales of different departments, the sales by mail
with those of personal salesmen.</p>

<p><b>Daily Sales Records.</b> The daily record of sales should show
the sales of each department, the source of the sales, and the proportion
of cash and credit sales. These should also be divided as
to wholesale and retail.</p>

<p>A convenient form is shown in Fig. 39. This is a sheet punched
for a loose-leaf book, and there should be as many copies as there
are men in the organization who are directly interested. Besides
the sales manager, the general manager, the advertising manager,
and the comptroller are all directly interested. By using carbon
paper as many copies as needed can be made at one writing.</p>

volume of business of each man. The form shown in Fig. 41 shows
a card used for a daily and monthly record of one salesman. The
form might be elaborated to show cost of goods, salary, expenses,
gross and net profits; but the tabulating of this information is
more properly the work of the statistical department.</p>

<p>These cards should be filed alphabetically by name of the salesman,
and divided according to states. They will then show the sales
of each man and in each territory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>For a business in which goods are sold by resident agents, a card

<h2 class="p4">THE CREDIT ORGANIZATION</h2>

<h3 class="p2">THE CREDIT MAN</h3>

<p>Acknowledged specialists may be employed in every branch of
an enterprise, the shrewdest brains may be engaged in buying, producing,
and selling, but the final conservator of the business is the
credit man; others may be profit makers, but he is the <i>profit saver</i>
in every commercial organization.</p>

<p>He is on guard constantly&mdash;always on the lookout for the slightest
sign of danger, ever ready to take prompt and vigorous action to avert
disaster to his house or to lend a helping hand to a customer. His
duties make him the most misunderstood man in the entire organization.</p>

<p>He is thorough, methodical, painstaking, a keen student of
human nature, possessing faith in the inherent honesty of his fellow
men. The insistent search for facts that he demands, may cause
him to be regarded as an inquisitive busybody by the very customer
whom he desires most to help; as a carping critic, by the salesman
of his own house.</p>

<p>Through it all he remains faithful to his trust, watchful of the
interests of his house, and has the satisfaction of knowing that in
spite of his mistakes but a remarkably small part of his credits
prove bad&mdash;that where his conservatism has lost hundreds in trade,
it has prevented the loss of thousands.</p>

<p>On no man in the organization is there such tremendous pressure
brought to bear to secure favors; on no man do the consequences of
his own mistakes come back so surely. The credit man must be
firm, and, while availing himself of every reliable source of information,
he must stick to his decisions, for he is expected to collect from
those to whom he has extended credit. Every other man has a loop-hole
through which he may escape criticism; if a customer is lost
because goods are unsatisfactory, it may be "up to" the salesman,
the shipping clerk, the superintendent, a foreman, or even an obscure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
mechanic. The credit man has no one on whom he can place
the blame; if a customer fails to pay, no reason short of an earthquake
will relieve the credit man of the responsibility.</p>

<p>So much for the credit man. Now for a discussion of the work
he is expected to do, the machinery of his office, and his methods of
operation&mdash;for the writer disclaims any intention of attempting to
teach the student how to become a credit man.</p>

<h3 class="p2">INFORMATION REQUIRED</h3>

<p>The most important function of the credit man is the determining
of the credit risk&mdash;the amount of credit that can safely be extended to
each individual. When he consents to the delivery of goods to be
paid for at a future date, he is loaning his firm's money.</p>

<p>Before credit is granted extreme care must be exercised in
determining the ability of the purchaser to pay, or that he will be
able to pay when the bill is due. After necessary precautions against
assuming too great a risk have been taken, a further insurance against
loss is included in the amount added to cost&mdash;a certain per cent of the
profit is expected to offset the risk.</p>

<p>In determining the credit risk, different classes of information
are necessary in different lines of business. While certain specific
information about individual applicants for credit is necessary, the
subject may be divided into two general classes&mdash;wholesale and retail.
Under the head of <i>wholesale</i>, is included information about all business
concerns, whether a single proprietor, a partnership, or a corporation.
In a general way also, the same information is required in respect
to these concerns by the banker, the manufacturer, the jobber, and
the wholesaler. Under the head of <i>retail</i>, is included the transactions
of a retailer with his customers, who may be regarded as individuals.</p>

<p>Leading authorities on the subject of credit place the factors
which determine the credit risk in two classes&mdash;the <i>man</i> and the
<i>business</i>. Under the first heading is considered the business morals
of the debtor and his ability in, and familiarity with the business in
which he is engaged. The second heading&mdash;the business&mdash;is considered
from the financial standpoint, divided as to its assets and
liabilities, and the profits or losses made in its operation.</p>

<p>But as to the relative importance of the two principal factors&mdash;the
man and the business&mdash;authorities differ. In his valuable contribution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
to the literature of credits, Mr. E. St. Elmo Lewis takes the
stand that the man&mdash;his character&mdash;should be considered secondary.
To quote from Mr. Lewis' book:</p>

<p class="pbq b1">If goods are the basis of all credit, character of the owner is and should
be an after consideration. The very first question any credit man should ask,
is, <i>can</i> he pay?</p>

<p class="pbq">The question of a man's ability to pay is becoming of greater ease of
solution.</p>

<p class="pbq">The question of the intention or inclination to pay must always be
shrouded in the nebulæ of psychological theory.</p>

<p class="pbq">What is the applicant worth? is the crucial test. Then we shall test
him by another. What sort of a man is he?</p>

<p class="pbq">Do we buy a law suit when we sell him goods?</p>

<p class="pbq">How much must we add for moral insurance against loss?</p>

<p class="pbq">Character is of vital importance in small concerns; of vital importance
in concerns doing a large business on small capital, and it becomes of less
importance as we progress into the field of corporations.</p>

<p class="p1">In direct contrast to this contention are the views of Mr. Ernest
Reckitt, as expressed in an address delivered before an organization
of bank clerks. After naming the factors to be considered by the
banker before extending credit, he said:</p>

<p class=" pbq p1">You will note that in enumerating these factors I place first, and purposely
so, "The Man Himself," and I believe I am correct in stating that
bankers are now placing more stress upon this point than ever before. The
man of good character and intelligence, who is full of energy and perseverance,
will not find it difficult to obtain a reasonable line of credit with his bankers,
while the man who is deficient in those qualities, whatever his reputed wealth
may be, will be looked upon with suspicion. It therefore behooves you to
become students of human character as well as students of banking, if you are
to fill the highest positions within your reach.</p>

<p class="pbq">These comments may be out of the range proposed by this paper, but I
feel I cannot leave this topic without giving you an illustration of the point I
wish to emphasize, namely: That it is the character of the man, or men, in a
business, which must be first considered before the banker makes a loan.
Some time ago, in a certain city, there was a large corporation reputed to be
very wealthy, whose balance-sheets were beautiful to behold. Their business
being large, they were borrowers of some of the largest banking institutions
of their city. Apparently without any warning the corporation was declared
bankrupt and went into the hands of a receiver. Later, investigation showed
that the balance-sheet was misleading; some people might have called it a
worse name, for the assets had been overstated and the liabilities understated.
I happened to be in that city at the time of this failure, and, meeting a director
of one of the banks with whom I was well acquainted, I inquired if his bank
had been caught. "No," said he, "they did try and open an account with us
some time ago with the object of becoming borrowers, but we turned them
down." I asked him what reasons he and his colleagues on the directorate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
had for such action at a time when this corporation was supposed to be so
prosperous. "Well," said my friend, "some time ago it came to my knowledge
that this corporation paid no water tax and that its personal property
tax was a mere bagatelle to what it should have been, and I figured out that
the officers of a corporation that would be guilty of petty bribery would not
be good customers for our bank."</p>

<p class="pbq b1">So it will be seen that a knowledge of the business morals of the men
in your community and a high ideal, on your part, of what constitutes good
business morals is a most essential quality in the make-up of a banker, and
that it was these factors that enabled the bank of which my friend was a
director to escape what otherwise would have been a bad debt.</p>

<p><b>Financial Statements.</b> Without attempting to decide the relative
importance of the two principal factors, it can safely be stated
that one of the first steps to be taken by the credit man is to secure a
financial statement from the applicant. And the character of the
statement may serve as a guide in determining the character of the
man with whom he has to deal.</p>

<p>Most business men are willing to comply with any reasonable
request relative to their financial standing, when applying for credit.
Until recently, the average man had objected to giving out such
statements, except to his bankers, but with the more universal demands
for such statements has come a change, and now a statement
of some sort is almost always obtainable.</p>

<p>The form of statements used by banks differ somewhat from
that used by manufacturers and jobbers, and, while it differs slightly
as between banks, and also as to whether the borrower is an individual,
a partnership, or a corporation, in general the statement required
follows the lines of the form shown in Fig. 1. This statement
is signed, in the name of the firm by a member, in the case of a partnership;
and in the name of the company by one of its officers, in the
case of a corporation. A statement in the same form gives all of the
information of a financial nature required by the manufacturer or
merchant.</p>

<p><b>Analysis of the Statement.</b> Of equal importance with the
statement is the ability to read it&mdash;to correctly interpret its real
meaning. This calls for a careful analysis of the several items of
which it is composed. To make a correct analysis means that the
credit man must have a general knowledge of the business in which
the one asking for credit is engaged. The banker must know, for
example, whether the season is one in which more capital is likely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
to be needed in the trade of the borrower, or one in which he should
be liquidating his indebtedness.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 1. Customer's Financial Statement</p>
</div></div>

<p>So important is this phase of the question that some of the larger
banks have adopted the plan of assigning requests for loans in different
businesses to different officers. One man will investigate
real estate securities, one, applications from board of trade houses,
another handles applications from packing houses, others look after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the steel, building, jobbing, and manufacturing enterprises. Each
man is a specialist, making a special study of conditions in the business
to which he is assigned.</p>

<p>In making an analysis of a statement, each item must be taken
up separately and considered with respect to its relationship to other
items, and its bearing on the statement as a whole.</p>

<p><i>Cash on Hand.</i> The cash on hand should be consistent with
the needs of the business, and, if listed separately, the cash in office
should never be a large sum. There is seldom any good reason why
cash should not be deposited daily. The banker will find it necessary
to carefully scrutinize the amount in bank, particularly if the borrower
claims to deposit in no other bank.</p>

<p><i>Merchandise.</i> This item is always a somewhat uncertain quantity;
often an estimate pure and simple, and the debtor is unlikely
to make his estimate too low. In the absence of provable figures,
it is necessary for the credit man to apply his knowledge of the business.
Is the stock larger than should be required? Is it too low to
enable the debtor to keep pace with his competitors? Or, if a manufacturing
business, how much is raw material and how much finished
goods?</p>

<p>One of the important factors in making an analysis of this item
is a knowledge of the accounting methods of the debtor. Does he
keep stock records, or if not, is his stock well cared for and stored in
a manner to permit of a reasonably accurate estimate? On the
latter point, reports of the observation of salesmen, referred to later
on, have an important bearing.</p>

<p><i>Bills Receivable.</i> On the statement form shown, this item is
divided as to notes, secured and unsecured, not due and past due.
To state that the amount of bills receivable is so much is one thing,
to state the amount not due, is quite another. Any considerable
amount of unsecured and past due paper indicates lax methods in
the debtor's own credit department.</p>

<p><i>Accounts Receivable.</i> This item is divided as to accounts less
than 60 days past due and accounts more than 60 days past due.
These items require the same close scrutiny as bills receivable.</p>

<p>The two items&mdash;bills and accounts receivable&mdash;should bear a
reasonably constant ratio to the amount of sales. Any unusual
increase in the percentage of book debts to sales calls for careful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
scrutiny, and leads to one of three conclusions: that trade conditions
are bad, that the credit department has been lax, or that the amount
is overstated.</p>

<p>The first of these conclusions is supported or rejected by the
credit man's knowledge of financial conditions in general, and of conditions
in the particular trade of the debtor. During a financial
panic, or in a season following crop failures, it is to be expected that
book debts will be greater in amount than in ordinary times. In
the event of the third conclusion, it is time for a careful investigation.
As a rule, the investigation will be productive of best results if an
examination of the books by a public accountant is included.</p>

<p><i>Due from Stockholders.</i> This is an item which must be carefully
studied. Who are the stockholders or partners who own the
firm, and for what? What is their financial responsibility?</p>

<p>Sometimes, stockholders whose entire fortunes are invested in a
corporation are found to be debtors to the same corporation for
borrowed money.</p>

<p><i>Due for Merchandise.</i> This item is divided as to accounts not
due and past due. It should be carefully compared with the same
item in statements furnished in the past. An increase may or may
not be due to natural causes such as the requirements of the trade
during a particular season.</p>

<p><i>Due for Borrowed Money.</i> Any increase in this item should be
offset by an increase in assets, or a decrease in other liabilities.</p>

<p><i>Liability as Surety.</i> This is an item of more importance than is
generally accorded to it. True, the liability is a contingent one,
but many a man has been forced into bankruptcy by the failure of
another, for whom he had become endorser.</p>

<p>Another item which should in the opinion of the writer appear
among the liabilities, is discounted paper. When a man discounts the
paper of a customer, received in the course of business, he assumes
a liability for the amount, if not paid at maturity. True, the liability
is contingent, but a liability nevertheless. The extent of the liability
depends on the prosperity of his own customers and the care
which he has exercised in accepting their paper.</p>

<p><b>Information for Retailers.</b> The information available for the
retailer is of a very different class. Here, the factor, the man himself,
plays a more important part. The retailer is obliged to depend more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
largely on his personal knowledge and the general reputation of his
customer.</p>

<p>The city retailer, for instance, needs to know where the man
works, his salary, his reputation for paying others&mdash;his landlord,
grocer, and butcher&mdash;and something about his personal habits and
general reputation.</p>

<p class="p10">How long has he been in his present position?<br />
Does he make frequent changes?<br />
Does he own a home?<br />
What rent does he pay?<br />
Any other wage earner in the family?</p>

<p>These are some of the questions, the answers to which will
assist in determining the credit risk.</p>

<p>The country retailer needs other information about his customers.
As a rule, he can answer all of the questions asked by the
city retailer in respect to his own customers. He is more intimately
acquainted with his customers; he has a better opportunity to learn
their characteristics and habits, than the city retailer. The country
retailer has another advantage, in that a closer bond of friendship
exists between him and his neighbor merchants. The interests of
city merchants are no less common, but distances separating them
make an interchange of views more difficult.</p>

<p>About his country customers&mdash;the farmers&mdash;the retailer requires
still different information. Besides full information about
the real estate owned, and mortgages given, he needs to know something
about the man himself.</p>

<p>
Does he market his crops early, or is he a speculator&mdash;always holding for possible higher prices?<br />
Is the farm well kept up?<br />
Are the implements properly housed, or left outside at the mercy of the elements?<br />
Does he keep his live stock in good condition, and how much does he feed for market?<br />
Is he thrifty or shiftless?<br />
</p>

<p>Only by personal contact can these things be learned. The
country merchant who keeps in closest touch with his farmer customers&mdash;sympathizing
with them in their misfortunes and rejoicing
in their prosperity&mdash;is usually the most successful. As one country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
merchant puts it, he must act as a general advisor, and help them
bear their very aches and pains.</p>

<h3 class="p2">SOURCES OF INFORMATION</h3>

<p>The usual sources of credit information are the mercantile
agencies, reports from local correspondents, reports from traveling
salesmen, and merchants' associations or credit reporting agencies.</p>

<p><b>Mercantile Agencies</b>. Of these sources, perhaps the best known
and most widely used by manufacturers and jobbers, is the mercantile
agency. The mercantile agency is the outgrowth of a necessity.
About the year 1840, a few New York merchants formed an association
for the interchange of credit information. Later, this became a
business conducted by individuals who charged a small fee for written
reports.</p>

<p>The business has grown to such proportions that a single agency
requires about 200 offices, located in the principal cities throughout
the world. In the territory of each office, which is presided over by
a manager, correspondents are employed, and at certain seasons
country reporters traverse every district, gathering data to be forwarded
to the branch offices. Every court house in the United
States has its paid correspondent, who promptly reports any action&mdash;as
the filing of suits, recording of mortgages, or entering of judgments&mdash;that
might affect the credit risk of any business man in the
country.</p>

<p>Some idea of the magnitude of the business, and the task of
gathering statistics, can be gained when it is considered that the books
of a single agency contain the names and ratings of about 1,500,000
persons. About each of these individuals, the latest data collected
by the reporters is on file in the various branch offices.</p>

<p>Delays in securing information is one of the most common complaints
against the agency service, but the service is probably as
prompt as can be expected. Suppose a request for a special report
is received this morning. First, the information on file is copied,
and proofread to guard against errors. This is sent to the subscriber,
but if it is not of a recent date he is advised that further information
will be forwarded. Or, there may be no data on file, in which event a
reporter is assigned to the case. He may be obliged to make several
calls before finding his man, and when found, the man may be reluctant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
about giving information. If real estate is listed, the real estate
man must look up the title and mortgage records. Thus, two or three
days may elapse before it is possible to furnish the report.</p>

<p>Some complaint is heard that reports furnished by the agencies
are not sufficiently specific&mdash;which is probably true in many cases&mdash;but
it is often quite difficult to obtain information on which positive
statements can be based. On the whole, the service of the agencies
is of very great value to the subscriber. As to its defects, the best
way to overcome them is for the wholesaler to establish a credit
organization of his own, to supplement the service of the agency.</p>

<p><b>Local Correspondents.</b> If the matter is properly handled, much
valuable information can be secured from local correspondents. The
banker, or a local attorney, is in a position to make confidential
reports on local merchants. In fact, the agencies secure much of
their information from this very source.</p>

<p>But, in establishing local correspondents, the exercise of good
judgment is necessary. The local attorney should not be expected
to furnish information without pay, or to go into details that would
not be asked of an agency charging $100.00 a year for the service.</p>

<p>An attorney has favored us with a blank sent out by one wholesale
house, on which he is asked to make a complete report. Among
other information requested, the blank calls for the value of merchandise,
realty, cash, total worth, liabilities, and numerous references
to his character, habits, etc. Following this statement is the question,
"if not paid, can you collect?"</p>

<p>Here is a very complete statement, to compile which would
require several hours' research, but without a single suggestion that
the attorney will receive pay. And then he is asked if he can collect,
after the house has exhausted all usual methods.</p>

<p>A certain other concern, when opening new territory, writes to
a local attorney telling him they are entering the field; that they will
require information from time to time, for which they expect to pay
a reasonable fee; and ask if he is in a position to represent them in this
capacity. At the same time the attorney is told that he will receive
for collection any accounts on which such action may be necessary.</p>

<p>When a special report is desired, the blank shown in Fig. 2 is
sent. The local correspondent is expected to give as full information
as possible, for which he is paid promptly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>In this way, excellent results are secured. There is some question
about the advisability of leaving the amount of the fee to the
correspondent. A better plan is to have the fee to be paid for all
ordinary reports decided in advance, extra compensation to be
allowed in special cases. The average country attorney will furnish an
intelligent report for two dollars&mdash;a low price for reliable information.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 2. Local Correspondents' Report Blank</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>Traveling Salesmen.</b> Certain information about the business and
general reputation of a customer can best be obtained through the
salesmen of the house. They are the men who come in direct contact
with the customers, acquiring an intimate knowledge of each.</p>

<p>The average salesman objects to making out lengthy reports,
but if approached in the right spirit, will give the credit man the
benefit of his observations. The salesman's judgment is scarcely to
be relied upon in the matter of the financial standing of a customer&mdash;his
anxiety to sell goods makes him too optimistic&mdash;but he is
probably the best judge of the character and business ability of a man
on whom he is calling regularly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>Frequently a spirit of antagonism to the credit department exists
among the salesmen. This condition indicates a decided lack of
that coöperation so necessary to the success of any business. The
credit man who possesses tact can overcome this antagonism, if he
will but drop his cold-blooded attitude and meet the salesmen on a
friendly basis. If he will cultivate their friendship, the salesmen
will respond with information of great value to him.</p>

<p>Naturally the information secured from a salesman differs from
that received from other sources. About the class of information
that can be expected is provided in the blank shown in Fig. 3. This
can be printed on a standard size card.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div></div>

<p><b>Retail Credit Reporting Agencies.</b> In many cities, merchants have
formed associations for the exchange of ledger experiences. Some of
these associations have been very successful, but the chief difficulty
has been in sustaining interest and in securing the necessary information.
This lack of interest seems to be general in mutual associations&mdash;every
man seems afraid that he will give more than he receives.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-156.jpg" width="400" height="294"

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">ADMINISTRATION BUILDING AT THE PLANT OF STUDEBAKER BROS. MANUFACTURING CO., SOUTH BEND, IND.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>Out of the merchants' association has grown the retail credit
reporting agency&mdash;the exchange of information being conducted as
a private enterprise. The expression, <i>exchange of information</i>, is
used advisedly, for the service of these agencies consists mostly of
reports giving the experiences of other merchants. To quote from the
prospectus of one of these concerns:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">Our company does for the retailer what Bradstreet and Dun do for the
wholesale dealer. We arrive at the result, however, in a different way. We
give accurate information as to how people pay their bills, regardless of their
financial standing.</p>

<p class="pbq">This information we get from merchants and professional men by means
of a thorough canvass of our entire territory. We visit all people doing business,
whether our subscribers or not, and in this way secure the names of all
consumers in business or private life.</p>

<p class="pbq">We are thus able to tell the grocer how Mr. <i>B.</i> pays his butcher, his tailor,
his hatter, his doctor, and every other trade or profession he deals with, and
each of these in turn is furnished with the same kind of information from the
grocer; thus we establish the exact credit standing of Mr. <i>B.</i> with the entire
trade of the city.</p>

<p class="pbq">Acting upon information thus furnished, every merchant or professional
man in the city knows from the most reliable and trustworthy source to whom
he can safely give credit and whom he should refuse.</p>

<p class="pbq">For example, we here give a specimen rating with an explanation of the
same.</p>

<p class="pbq">"John Doe, carpenter, 187 Broad St., <i>5G 2F.</i>"</p>

<p class="pbq">This rating indicates that five different merchants have found by experience
that John Doe is a prompt paying credit customer, and two other
merchants have found him somewhat slow, but regard him reliable and trustworthy.</p>

<p class="pbq">Next example:</p>

<p class="pbq">"John A. Doe, lawyer, 210 North Second St., <i>4D 3B.</i>"</p>

<p class="pbq">This rating indicates that four different merchants have found him too
slow in paying to be a desirable credit customer, and three other merchants
have found him bad pay and unworthy of credit confidence.</p>

<p class="p1">Other sources of information, which come under the head of
exchanges of ledger experiences, are the credit men's associations.
These associations, through clearing houses, exchange information
about their customers, thus supplying the wholesaler with the same
class of information as described above for retailers.</p>

<p>One credit man relates the following incident, illustrating the
value of the association clearing house. On one of the reports
furnished by the clearing house, he noticed that another merchant had
refused credit to one of his own customers. Investigation developed
the fact that this particular customer's locality had suffered severely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
from the destruction of crops by a cyclone. Now it happened that this
credit man's house was about to fill a large order from this very customer.
The shipment was held up, and the credit man promptly
wrote to the merchant expressing regret that his community had
suffered so severely, and asking if his house could be of any assistance
to him. In closing the letter, the suggestion was made that since
collections were likely to be slow with the merchant, they would
allow him to cut down his order.</p>

<p>The letter had the desired effect. Instead of turning him down
the merchant was made to feel that he had friends in that house, and
it is probable that he continued to be one of their valued customers.</p>

<h3 class="p2">RECORDING CREDIT INFORMATION</h3>

<p>Scattered information is of little value. A credit man may avail
himself of all sources of credit information, but unless he has it filed
and recorded where he can put his hand on it, he will find it of little
assistance in determining credit risks. He cannot "keep it in his
head" and get the best results.</p>

<p>There are credit men who profess to rely largely on intuition,
but the hard-headed man&mdash;the one who makes the fewest mistakes&mdash;relies
on his facts and figures. He uses judgment, but first wants
the facts marshaled in logical order.</p>

<p><b>Filing.</b> The method of filing best adapted to the needs of a
given concern depends on the size of the business, number of customers,
method of collecting information, and the quantity of data
kept on file. In a small business, depending almost entirely on the
ratings of the mercantile agencies, with an occasional special report,
no special filing system is necessary. The few reports received can
be filed with the regular correspondence. But in a well-organized
credit department, handling credit information about a large number
of customers, the question of filing is of importance.</p>

<p>In the first place, all reports should be kept in one place; special
agency reports, reports of traveling salesmen, local correspondents,
and the credit clearing house, with financial statements furnished by
the customer, should be filed together. This means that they should
be separated from the general correspondence; if filed with the
correspondence, they are sure to become scattered when the files are
transferred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>Without question, the most satisfactory method of filing is to
use the vertical file, with a folder for each customer. For the average
business, an alphabetical index is most satisfactory, but for a very
large business, with customers throughout the country, it is best to
subdivide the file by states and towns, arranging the folders of customers
in each town alphabetically.</p>

<p>Credit reports are not, as a rule, of sufficient bulk to require the
large files and folders used for correspondence. A file of the same
style, to accommodate folders about 7×9 inches in size, is more
compact, and has been found very satisfactory for this purpose.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 4. Front of Credit Information Folder</p>
</div></div>

<p>A plain folder, such as is used for correspondence, will answer
the purpose, or a special form may be substituted. An excellent
example of the special folder is shown in Fig. 4.The special feature
of this folder is that on the flap which folds over the front provision
is made for a transcript of credit information. The back of this
folder is printed as shown in Fig. 5. This form is used for a record
of purchases, and covers a period of seven years.</p>

<p><b>Card Transcripts.</b> For convenience, it is best to make a brief
transcript of the credit information. This transcript should embody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
the essential facts which naturally influence the credit risk, and should
be in such form that it can be referred to very readily.</p>

<p>As explained above, this transcript can be made on the credit
information folder, but the more usual plan is to use a card. For
each customer a card such as shown in Fig. 6. is used. The special
feature of this card is that both the capital and credit ratings are
listed. Such a card saves the time that would be required to refer to
the agency books, and affords a comparison of the ratings given by the
agencies on different dates. Both the book ratings and special
reports are entered on this card.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 5. Back of Credit Information Folder</p>
</div></div>

<p>A card which provides for reports, other than those furnished
by the agencies, is shown in Fig. 7. A line for the folder number
will be noted at the top, a numerical system of filing the folders
being used. Although the numerical system is frequently found,
it has no practical advantages, and the alphabetical system is to be
preferred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>The form shown in Fig. 8 provides for more general information
about the business&mdash;such information as would be gathered from the
reports of salesmen and local correspondents. It will be noted, also,
that the financial information refers more especially to the firm members.
This card is used to supplement the books of the agencies.</p>

<p>The card shown in Fig. 9 gives a complete history of reports
asked and received, and of credits granted. This form is used in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
business in which the purchases of a customer are infrequent, and involve
considerable sums. The credit risk is considered each time
an order is received.</p>

<p>The card shown in Fig. 10 is used by a retailer. As is usual in
retail credits, the information provided for in this form refers to past
experiences and the general reputation of the customer.</p>

<p>Like the folders used for filing credit statements and reports,
credit cards should be indexed alphabetically, subdivided by states
and towns when necessary. Filed in this manner, each card is
accessible, and can be referred to quickly. An advantage of cards
for this and many other purposes is that obsolete matter is quickly
eliminated, and new names are added at will without disturbing the
general arrangement of the records.</p>

<h3 class="p2">BRANCH HOUSE CREDITS</h3>

<p>Many businesses are conducted through branch houses, each in
charge of a local manager. Customers are supplied by the branches,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
and it is customary to have each branch house collect its own accounts.
Weekly reports of the business transacted, including sales, collections,
and stock on hand, are made by each branch to the home office.
Duplicate accounts, made up from these reports, enable the home
office to keep in as close touch with each account as though collections
were made direct.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div></div>

<p>Large concerns, operating many branches, have found by experience
that it is best to pass on all local applications for credit at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
the home office. This work is handled by a division of the credit
organization, known as the <i>branch house credit department</i>.</p>

<p>The forms shown and the system described herein were designed
for the use of an oil company, and are very similar to those used by
the large packing companies. When a dealer wishes to secure credit
at a branch, the form shown in Fig. 11 is filled out in duplicate and
signed by the local manager. The original is forwarded to the home
office, while the duplicate is filed in the branch office, under the name
of the applicant. Folders are used for this purpose.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-164.jpg" width="400" height="342"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 11. Branch Office Credit Application</p>
</div></div>

<p>Only the lower half of this form is filled in at the branch office.
The rating, credit limit, and terms are entered when a reply is received
from the home office.</p>

<p>When the application is received at the home office, the files are
consulted for any information that may have been received previously,
reports are asked from the agencies, and the decision made. The
decision is made known to the branch house on the form shown in
Fig. 12.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>This form is made in duplicate, both the original and copy being
forwarded to the branch. The original is placed in the branch house
files, together with the application for credit. Both the cashier and
the manager of the branch sign the duplicate, as an acknowledgment
that they understand the terms, and it is then forwarded to the home
office.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-165.jpg" width="400" height="347"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 12. Branch Office Credit Notice</p>
</div></div>

<p>In the home office, the original application and the statement of
terms granted, signed by the branch manager, are filed together. A
folder is used for each customer, filed alphabetically with subdivisons
for states and towns. Every subsequent report and memorandum
of credit information is filed in this folder.</p>

<p>When the report from a branch house shows an account to be
past due, an inquiry blank, as shown in Fig. 13, is sent to the branch.
This is in duplicate, the copy being retained at the branch house,
and the original forwarded to the home office. In both offices, this
report is eventually filed in the folder with other credit information.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>A noticeable feature of this system is that all blanks are made
in duplicate. This insures duplicate credit files in the home office
and branches. It is, of course, necessary for each office to forward
to the other any special data that may be received, from whatever
source.</p>

<h3 class="p2">COLLECTIONS</h3>

<p>The duties of the credit man are not ended when he has passed
on the credit of a prospective customer; a very important duty
follows, and that is to collect the accounts that he has placed on the
books. He may assign the handling of collections to another, but the
collection desk should be under the supervision of the credit man.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-166.jpg" width="400" height="344"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 13. Branch Office Credit Inquiry Blank</p>
</div></div>

<p>The handling of collections furnishes one of the most severe tests
of the ability of the credit man; it calls for the exercise of a certain
tact, not absolutely essential in any other work in business life. The
successful collector must, first of all, be a good judge of character;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
he must be able to read character, and govern himself by what he
learns of his customer's peculiarities. He must be a diplomat, with
the happy faculty of smoothing out the rough spots, and satisfying
the chronic kicker. While using judgment in granting special
favors to the slow-pay customer, he must be able to differentiate
between the temporarily embarrassed but able and honest debtor,
and him who continually makes use of a hard-luck story to arouse
sympathy and gain time; he must know when to be gently firm, and
when to take vigorous action to save his house from loss.</p>

<p>One of the essential accomplishments of a good collector is the
ability to write diplomatic letters. Collection correspondence is
in a class by itself. The most valuable correspondent is said to be
he who can write letters that sell goods. We have no fault to find
with this statement, but prefer the way Mr. Cody puts it&mdash;"the ability
to write letters that make people do things." The collection correspondent
must be able to write letters that make people do things.</p>

<p>In a wholesale or manufacturing business, or any business that
is not strictly local, practically all of the collections are made by mail,
hence the subject of collection correspondence becomes of extreme
importance. The extent to which letters are used is naturally
governed by the ideas of the collector; by some they are used freely,
by others as special appeals or duns only. One very successful
credit man, who has handled the collections in one of the largest
mercantile establishments in the country, gives it as his opinion that
a letter should be sent with every request for payment&mdash;even with
the monthly statement.</p>

<p>Except in unusual cases, specially dictated letters are not necessary;
filled-in form letters answer every purpose&mdash;indeed it is claimed
by many that carefully prepared form letters, designed to meet certain
definite conditions, are superior to letters dictated in the ordinary
rush of business. Forms can be prepared for different classes of
customers, and to meet any of the contingencies likely to arise in the
ordinary business. Form letters used for collection purposes should
be exceptionally well printed, and great care must be used to secure
ribbons that are an exact match for the body of the letter. There
is nothing more calculated to make an unfavorable impression than
a letter in which the date, name, and address fail by several shades
to match the body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>The exact form of the letters must be varied to suit the particular
business in which they are to be used; they will differ in manufacturing,
wholesale, and retail lines, in a mail-order business, or for
installment accounts. In a manufacturing business, for instance,
a letter something like the following might be sent with the monthly
statement.</p>

<p class="pn15a"><span class="smcap">Dear sir</span>:</p>

<p class="p15rn">In accordance with our usual custom, we enclose a statement of
your account as it appears on our books at this date. Will you kindly
compare this with your records, and advise us of any discrepancies.</p>

<p class="p15rn">That we might be in a position to fill your orders promptly, we
have kept our factory running on full time during the past few months,
which has involved quite a heavy investment in material. We will,
therefore, appreciate a check from you covering the amount shown
to be due.</p>

<p class="p15rn">We will also appreciate a liberal order, which we can fill at once,
as our stocks are unusually complete just now.</p>

<p class="p35rn">Very truly yours,</p>

<p>Such a letter leaves a very much better taste than <i>please remit</i>
stamped on the statement, and yet it plainly asks for a remittance.
There is something about the letter that savors of the personal appeal,
and gives the debtor the feeling that a special accommodation is
being asked, which he should make an effort to grant.</p>

<p>If the first letter fails to bring a response, it should be followed
up. The second letter, following the first in about 10 days, might
be as follows:</p>

<p class="pn15a"><span class="smcap">Dear sir</span>:</p>

<p class="p15rn">A few days ago we sent you a statement of your account, showing
a balance of $<span class="vh">&mdash;&mdash;</span>, of which $<span class="vh">&mdash;&mdash;</span> is past due.</p>

<p class="p15rn">Not having heard from you, we assume that the account is correct,
and that it will be satisfactory to you to have us draw on you on
the 15th.</p>

<p class="p15rn">In the meantime we will be very pleased to fill your order for
any of our goods that you may need.</p>

<p class="p35rn">Very truly yours,</p>

<p>A letter of this kind rarely fails to bring a goodly percentage of
remittances. The mere suggestion of a draft often has the desired
effect. The average merchant dislikes to have a draft presented;
he feels that it has a tendency to injure his credit with the very man
whom he may be obliged to ask for an accommodation&mdash;his banker.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
The polite request for an order acts as a sugar coating which covers the
suggestion of a dun, and leaves the recipient in a pleasant frame of
mind.</p>

<p>The second paragraph of the above letter does not contain a
positive statement that a draft will be made, nevertheless, such a
course is hinted at, and, unless a communication of some kind is
received, the draft should invariably be made on the date specified.
The customer should be taught that the collector means just what
he says; any other course indicates a lack of sincerity, and gives the
customer the feeling that these notices are not to be regarded seriously.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is possible to go to the opposite extreme
in the use of drafts. The writer has in mind a business man who had
a habit of sending statements of all accounts the first of the month,
without a letter, and following these with drafts about a week later.
Many times these drafts were made before it was possible for a
remittance in response to the statement to reach him, which caused
hard feelings, and the loss of many customers. It is the custom of
many firms to pay all bills on a certain day of the month&mdash;a fact
which the observant collector quickly notes, and governs himself
accordingly in the matter of sending drafts.</p>

<p>When a draft is returned, a letter should be written immediately;
and in this letter a little sharper tone is justifiable. The following is
a good sample of a letter to be used at this point:</p>

<p class="pn15a"><span class="smcap">Dear sir</span>:</p>

<p class="p15rn">We are disappointed to find that you have allowed our draft to be
returned unpaid, as we had counted on this amount to help in meeting
our current obligations. While the amount of your indebtedness is
not large, the aggregate of the many small accounts makes up the large
amount outstanding on our books, and to not receive the amount
when due, causes us considerable embarrassment.</p>

<p class="p15rn">As you know, our terms are strictly 30 days net. We must insist
on receiving prompt payment when bills are due; our prices are figured
on this basis, and our arrangements for meeting supply bills
and pay-rolls are dependent on the prompt payment of bills by our
customers.</p>

<p class="p15rn">Your total indebtedness to us is $<span class="vh">&mdash;&mdash;</span>, of which $<span class="vh">&mdash;&mdash;</span> is
several days past due. We would appreciate a remittance of the entire
amount, but must insist on the immediate payment of the amount
past due. Failing to receive either a remittance or your note, by the
23rd, we will again draw on you, and shall expect you to pay the draft
when presented.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p class="p15rn">By the way, our Mr. Jackson reports that he has failed to secure
an order from you on his last two trips. Now if you have any cause for
dissatisfaction, we would like to have you tell us, as we are more than
anxious to please you, and would certainly appreciate your future
orders.</p>

<p class="p35rn">Very truly yours,</p>

<p>One point in this letter, to which special attention is called, is
the absence of the word <i>dishonor</i>. Technically, when a draft is not
paid it is dishonored, but the word has an ugly sound; the word <i>unpaid</i>
is less harsh, yet conveys the desired meaning. While it is
sometimes necessary to be quite emphatic, nothing is gained by
adopting a tone calculated to arouse the antagonism of the debtor.
The time-honored axiom that "More flies can be caught with sugar
than with vinegar," is given a special force when considered in connection
with collection letters.</p>

<p>Naturally, these letters must be varied to suit the business, the
season, and general trade conditions. They are not submitted as
models, to be used under all circumstances, but to impart an idea&mdash;the
idea of <i>tone</i>, the sugar coating which is so essential in keeping the
recipient in the right frame of mind. Politely request, ask plainly
for what you want, firmly demand, but never threaten until you are
prepared to carry out your threat. This is a safe rule to follow in
handling collections.</p>

<h3 class="p2">COLLECTION SYSTEMS</h3>

<p>In the successful handling of collections, a requisite is promptness.
There must be a system that will insure bringing collections
to notice at the right time. Without attempting to lay down specific
systems for individual concerns, detailed descriptions of systems that
have been found satisfactory in different businesses are given herein.</p>

<p><b>Duplicate Invoices.</b> The tendency at the present time is to
regard each invoice as a separate account, and to regard each as due
at the end of the time specified&mdash;thirty, sixty, or ninety days. An
exception is found in the accounts of city customers. A wholesale
merchant may have customers in his own city who buy in small
quantities, placing orders nearly every day. The usual rule is to regard
these as monthly accounts, the account for one month being
due the 15th of the following month. For out-of-town customers,
however, the first plan is found more satisfactory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>A certain large manufacturer, whose business is world wide,
treats each invoice as a separate account, and handles the collections
in a very simple manner. All invoices are made in duplicate, the
original going to the customer. From the duplicate, all entries are
made on the books. If special terms are granted, these terms are
stamped on the back of the duplicate invoice.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-171.jpg" width="400" height="340"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 14. Collection Card for Each Invoice]</p>
</div></div>

<p>When it has served the purpose in the accounting department,
the duplicate invoice is returned to the collection desk. Here it is
filed under the date on which it is due.</p>

<p>The file is a simple arrangement of pigeon holes. A case containing
sixty pigeon holes, large enough to hold invoices laid flat,
is used. These pigeon holes are divided into two sets of thirty
each, one above the other, and each set is numbered from <i>1</i> to <i>30</i>.
This number provides for filing ahead sixty days, which is the longest
credit term allowed.</p>

<p>In operating the filing system, the two sets of pigeon holes represent
alternate months. During January, bills due in March are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
filed in the upper pigeon holes; in February, bills due in April are
filed in the lower case. Each day the bills due are removed from
the file for attention, leaving the pigeon hole empty for filing bills due
sixty days ahead. On March 10th, for instance, bills are removed from
the <i>No. 10</i> pigeon hole of the upper case; the current day's bills, due
May 10th, are then filed in the same pigeon hole.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 15. Card Tickler for Collections</p>
</div></div>

<p>When bills come out for attention, they are referred to the accounting
department to find if they have been paid. For those not
paid, statements are prepared and returned with the bills to the
collection desks. The usual letters are written, and all past due
bills are held in a desk tickler, that they may be followed up from
day to day by the collection clerk.</p>

<p>This system can be operated with the regular tickler file, but for
a large number of bills the pigeon holes are more convenient. A
modification is necessary, also, when the bill and charge system is
used. In that case, an extra copy of the invoice should be made
for the use of the collection clerk.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Card Tickler.</b> A very convenient method, where it is not deemed
advisable to use duplicate invoices, is to fill in a collection card for
each invoice.</p>

<p>A card, printed similarly to the form shown in Fig. 14, is filed
under the date on which the account is due. Each day, all cards
filed under that date are removed for attention. The first step is to
compare the cards with the ledger accounts. If the account has
been paid, the card is destroyed; if not, a statement is sent and the
card filed ahead to the next follow-up date. All letters written and all
steps taken are noted on the card, so that in the end it presents a
complete history of the efforts made to collect the account.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-175.jpg" width="400" height="254"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 16. Collection Card for Alphabetical Cross-Indexing</p>
</div></div>

<p>A slightly different form of card, which is used in the same
manner, is shown in Fig. 15.</p>

<p><b>Cross-Indexing.</b> The same objection exists in regard to the use
of the tickler card for collections as for other follow-up purposes,
which is the difficulty of finding the cards. Every time a card is
removed from the file it is necessary to compare it with the ledger
to find if the account has been paid.</p>

<p>To overcome the difficulty, a card with an alphabetical tab is
used to good advantage. Such a card is shown in Fig. 16. It will be
noted that this card bears a tab printed with the letter <i>G</i>. A card<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
with this tab is used for every name that commences with <i>G</i>, and as
all <i>G</i> tabs are in the same position on the card, they will be in direct
line from front to back of the file.</p>

<p>The cards are filed by dates, but each day all remittances are
sent to the collection desk, that the cards representing accounts that
have been paid may be removed. All cards may be found by name,
by referring to the lettered tabs, thus Brown's card will be found in
the row of <i>B</i> tabs.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-176.jpg" width="400" height="346"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 17. Collection Card for Cross-Indexing by Date</p>
</div></div>

<p>Another method of cross-indexing the collection file is to have
the numbers from <i>1</i> to <i>31</i>, representing the days of the month, printed
across the top of the card, as shown in Fig. 17. To indicate the due
date a metal tab is placed over the proper number, a red tab being
used for succeeding months and a black tab for the current month.</p>

<p>The cards are filed alphabetically by name, or subdivided by
states and towns, so that any desired card can be found instantly.
Each day all cards having tabs over that date are removed for attention.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
On the first of the month those bearing red tabs are referred
to, and if due in the current month, black tabs are substituted.</p>

<p><b>Monthly Statements.</b> In some houses, it is the practice to
follow up collections on the basis of the monthly statement, instead
of treating each invoice independently. When this is done the collection
record must include a synopsis of the entire account. The
card shown in Fig. 18 is used for following collections on such accounts.
This form shows the date and amount of statements, with
interest added, date and amount of drafts, and dates and amounts of
payments. Other columns are provided for a record of letters,
promises, extensions, etc.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 18. Collection Card Showing Synopsis of Entire Account</p>
</div></div>

<p>This card is handled in exactly the same manner as it would be
if used for a single invoice. While the card shown is used in a tickler,
it would be improved by the addition of the numbers across the top,
which would permit of alphabetical indexing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Local Collections.</b> Collections from local customers are usually
made by collectors. In handling such collections, a system that will enable
the office to keep track of the work of each collector is necessary.</p>

<div class="floatleft">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center"> Fig. 19. Triplicate Statement<br /> for Collectors</p>
</div></div>

<p>One large mercantile concern has solved the problem by using
the following system. This concern has a large number of customers
who make frequent
purchases.
For convenience,
the city is divided
into four sections,
one for
each week in the
month. Each
section is divided
into five parts,
representing the
days of the week
from Monday to
Friday, inclusive.
One collector
covers the entire
city, calling on
each customer
once a month.</p>

<p>Arrangements
are made with
the customers in
each section to
pay their bills at
a certain time
each month&mdash;the
bills of all
customers in the
first section are collectible during the first week in the month.
Each customer knows, also, on what day of the week he is to expect
the collector.</p>

<p>Statements are made Saturday morning for all accounts to be
collected the following week. These statements are made in triplicate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
as shown in Fig. 19. Two copies are given to the collector, who
arranges them in a file according to his daily routes. One copy is
kept in the office, filed by routes.</p>

<p>When the collector makes his call, he receipts one copy of the
statement and delivers it to the customer. The second copy is kept
by the collector and turned in with the collection. If the customer
is not found, or if he fails to pay, both copies of the statement must
be turned in by the collector.</p>

<p>Each morning the collector makes his report for the previous
day. The cashier compares the collector's report with his copies
of the statements, and, as the collector must turn in both of his copies
when no payment has been made, a safe check is had on the collector.
To make the check more positive, it is the custom of the cashier to
mail a copy of the statement to those customers who have made no
payments, or partial payments, requesting them to compare with
their records and advise if any discrepancies are found. This makes
it impossible for the collector to hold out collections without detection.</p>

<p><b>Collecting from the Ledger.</b> In many houses having no organized
credit department, the collections are handled by the bookkeeper.
When this work is added to his many other duties, the bookkeeper is
obliged to devise some scheme that will eliminate detail&mdash;he has no
time to make additional records. His method is to follow up collections
direct from the ledger.</p>

<p>But there must be some method of bringing the accounts to notice
when they require attention&mdash;an automatic system. The most
simple scheme is shown in Fig. 20. Across the end of the ledger
sheet&mdash;which is loose-leaf&mdash;- numbers representing the days of the
month are printed, and metal markers, or tabs, are attached over the
due dates.</p>

<p>To represent different stages in the collection of the accounts,
different colors are used. When a charge is posted to the ledger
sheet, a black tab is placed over the date on which the bill falls due.
When payments are posted the tabs are removed, provided the account
is paid in full; otherwise it is moved forward to the next due
date. After the day's remittances are posted, all sheets with black
tabs over the current date are referred to, and statements made. At
the same time, white tabs are substituted for the black.</p>

<p>The next step is to make drafts for all accounts on which white
tabs have appeared ten days, that is, on the 10th drafts are made for
all accounts with white tabs over the 30th. Blue tabs are then substituted
for white. If the draft is returned, a red tab is substituted.
The red tabs indicate accounts past due, which are subject to such
action as may be considered advisable. This ledger sheet, with the
adjustable tabs, insures attention to collections, regardless of the
method of filing.</p>

<p><b>Handling Drafts.</b> When drafts are used extensively, considerable
detail is involved in handling the records. Any method that
will reduce this detail means a material reduction in the expense of
conducting the work of the collection desk.</p>

<p>The usual method is to write the draft and register it in a draft
record book. Then the necessary record is made on the collection
card. A draft register is used that there may be a record showing
the aggregate of drafts outstanding, and the number and amount in
the hands of each bank&mdash;where drafts are sent direct, instead of
through a local bank. The next step is to write a letter of advice to
the bank. This method necessitates writing the names of the bank,
the drawee, and the amount of the draft three times&mdash;on the draft,
letter of advice, and draft register.</p>

<p>By the use of properly designed forms, this duplication can be
avoided. Fig. 21 shows a set of forms designed for the purpose. <i>A</i>
is the original draft, <i>B</i> is the letter of advice to the bank, <i>C</i> is a letter
of advice to the drawee, and <i>D</i> is the office record. The draft, <i>A</i>,
is attached to the letter of advice, <i>B</i>, and is detached by the bank.
The four forms are so printed that the date, name of the bank, amount,
and name and address of the drawee register perfectly. The blanks
are properly spaced for use in a typewriter, and all copies are made
with one writing.</p>

<p>Copies <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are mailed to the bank, and <i>C</i> to the drawee.
From copy <i>D</i> the record is made on the collection card, after which
it is filed in a card tray, under the name of the bank. This keeps
copies of all drafts sent to each bank together, and the total of all
drafts outstanding is quickly obtained on an adding machine. When
payments are made, or drafts are returned, these copies are removed
from the files. Frequent reference to the file insures the necessary
follow-up on banks that are slow in reporting.</p>

<p><b>Installment Collections.</b> Probably the most difficult class of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
accounts to handle from a collection standpoint is installment accounts.
Payments are quite irregular, both as to time and amount, and
frequent changes of address make it difficult to keep track of debtors.</p>

<p>The collector
of installment
accounts must
have the faculty
of meeting and
satisfying all
sorts of people.
He is obliged to
listen to hard-luck
tales without
number, and
while sympathizing
with the
customers, must
be patiently persistent.
If unable
to collect
the dollar due,
he will accept a
half-dollar to
keep the account
active. So long
as he collects
<i>something</i>, each
time a payment
is due, he is in
a position to
make the debtor
feel the importance
of the contract,
but let one
or two collection days go by without a payment, and the debtor has the
upper hand. He then feels that he can stand-off the collector whenever
he happens to have other uses for his money, a condition
which becomes increasingly frequent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>An installment dealer will nurse an account to the limit, rather
than take back the goods he has sold. Once he has collected the
cost of the article, he will accept payments of almost any amount,
but it will not do to let the debtor know how lenient he is prepared
to be; at least a semblance of enforcing the contract must be kept up.</p>

<p>The most familiar branch of the installment business is the sale
of house furnishings and pianos. The sale of house furnishings on
the installment plan is rapidly increasing, and probably more pianos
are sold on this than any other plan. Furniture dealers who formerly
sold only for cash or on approved credits, are finding profitable business
among the better class of installment buyers.</p>

<p>Installment sales are made on contracts, or leases, which provide
that title to the goods shall be held by the seller until all payments
have been made, and that the right of possession shall be forfeited
by the buyer if he fails to make any payment when due. When the
contract is folded, the outside shows a form printed as in Fig. 22.
This particular form is used by a musical instrument house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>At the head of the form is shown the contract number, amount,
date of contract and collection date, name and address of the buyer,
and the name, number, and make of instrument. Below is space
for a record of payments, divided as to principal and interest, with
the names of the collectors. When a sale is made, a contract is made
in duplicate, the original remaining in possession of the seller and the
duplicate being given to the purchaser.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 24. Ledger for Installment Accounts</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>Installment Register.</b> All contracts are registered in numerical
order, in an installment register ruled as shown in Fig. 23. One
line is used for each contract, the particulars recorded being the date
and number of the contract, name and address of the buyer, and the
amounts to be credited to the different sales accounts. It is not
necessary to list the articles sold, as a complete list will be found in
the contract.</p>

<p>The footings of the money columns are carried forward to the
end of the month, when the totals are credited to the sales accounts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
in the general ledger. The footing of the <i>total</i> column, which is
the total of all installment sales, is posted to the <i>debit</i> of an <i>installment
contract</i> account in the general ledger. This is a controlling
account of the installment ledger accounts.</p>

<p><b>Installment Ledger.</b> Installment accounts necessitate a form
of ledger differing from that used for ordinary accounts. The special
requirement in such a ledger is space for recording a large number
of payments. Fig. 24 shows a form of loose-leaf ledger sheet designed
for installment accounts.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 25. Special Cash Receipt Book for Installment Collections</p>
</div></div>

<p>One of these ledger sheets is used for each installment contract.
The particulars of the contract are recorded at the head of the ledger
sheet, above the name and address. The particulars recorded are
the number of the contract, the amount and date, amount of payments,
collection day, and whether payments are to be made weekly
or monthly. The body of the form is ruled for a record of payments
and balances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>The ledger sheets are arranged in alphabetical order, about five-hundred
sheets in each binder. Each alphabetical section is separately
indexed to afford quick reference to all accounts. If the contract
number only is known, reference is had to the installment register,
where all contracts are recorded in numerical order.</p>

<p><b>Cash Receipts.</b> For installment collections, it is well to provide
a special cash receipt book. Such a form is shown in Fig. 25. This
form is used exclusively for installment receipts, and payments are
posted direct to the installment ledger. The total cash for the day
is entered as one item in the general cash book.</p>

<p><b>Statement of Installment Ledger.</b> From an accounting standpoint,
installment accounts present certain difficulties not experienced
in the handling of other classes of accounts receivable. There is
always a question as to the real value of the accounts outstanding,
a doubt as to the advisability of including the total balances in a
statement of assets. A live account&mdash;one on which payments are
being made regularly&mdash;is legitimately considered as good an asset as
any other account receivable, but the value of the delinquent account&mdash;when
payments are past due&mdash;is questionable, and if included in a
balance sheet, the nature of the asset should be clearly stated.</p>

<p>That the actual condition of these accounts may be shown on
the general ledger, it is the better practice to carry two accounts,
representing live and delinquent accounts. Installment sales should
be charged to an <i>Installment Accounts Receivable</i> account, and payments
credited to the same account, which then becomes a general
ledger controlling account of the live accounts in the installment
ledger. Another account should be opened in the general ledger
under some such caption as <i>Installment Accounts Delinquent</i>.
When accounts become delinquent, they should be transferred by
journal entry to this account. The journal entry would be:</p>

<p class="pn20"><i>Installment Accounts Delinquent</i></p>
<p class="pn25"><i>Installment Accounts Receivable</i></p>

<p>This transfer may be made daily, weekly, or monthly, but the period
between transfers should never be longer than one month. Delinquent
accounts may be indicated in the installment ledger by placing
a metal tab of some distinctive color on the ledger sheet or card, or
they may be segregated by transferring them to a special delinquent
binder or file.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 26. Daily Report of Installment Accounts for the Credit Man</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>When a payment is received on a delinquent account, that
account immediately becomes live, and the amount should be transferred
by journal entry to <i>Installment Accounts Receivable</i>. The
journal entry would be:</p>

<p class="pn20"><i>Installment Accounts Receivable</i></p>
<p class="pn25"><i>Installment Accounts Delinquent</i></p>

<p>Each day, the amount of accounts revived&mdash;delinquent accounts on
which payments have been received&mdash;should be ascertained. If it
is desired to save the labor of making journal entries daily, a memorandum
of these amounts may be kept and a journal entry made at
the end of the month.</p>

<p>When a delinquent account reaches the condition where it is considered
worthless, the amount should be charged to profit and loss,
by the journal entry:</p>

<p class="pn20"><i>Profit and Loss</i></p>
<p class="pn25"><i>Installment Accounts Delinquent</i></p>

<p>This should be done whenever the credit man carefully examines
all delinquent accounts, which should be not less frequently
than once a month. When payments are received on these accounts,
they should be treated as revived accounts, with proper credit to
profit and loss, if revived during the current fiscal period; but if,
in the meantime, the books have been closed, they should be treated
as new accounts.</p>

<p>It is quite necessary for the credit man to know every day how
the installment accounts are running. That he may do this, a daily
report, as shown in Fig. 26, should be made by the installment collection
clerk. The report form should be in loose-leaf, and if the
installment sales are divided by departments, the necessary number
of columns to accommodate the departmental records may be provided.</p>

<p>The report is headed with the amounts of accounts outstanding,
divided as to live and delinquent. New accounts opened and delinquents
revived are added in the live column, and delinquents revived
are deducted from the delinquent column. Cash collections, discounts
and allowances, and delinquents today are deducted separately
from the live accounts, and delinquents today added to the delinquent
column. Then the delinquents charged to profit and loss are deducted
from the delinquent column. The balances represent the
net amount of outstanding accounts, and must agree with the two
controlling accounts, <i>Installment Accounts Receivable</i> and <i>Installment
Accounts Delinquent</i>.</p>

<p>Such a report enables the manager or credit man to keep in touch
with the actual condition of installment accounts. As a rule, three
copies should be made, one for the manager, one for the credit man,
and one to be kept on file by the collection clerk.</p>

<p><b>Filing Contracts.</b> Some houses follow the practice of allowing
the collector to carry the original contracts, and in such cases the
contracts are filed according to the dates on which payments are due.
It is claimed that it is necessary for the collector to have the contract,
as the customer is quite liable to lose the duplicate and may ask for
particulars about the items purchased.</p>

<p>This plan is not advocated on account of the liability of loss
of contracts. If it is desirable for the collector to carry the contract,
a third copy should be made for that purpose. Original contracts
should be kept in a fire-proof safe, and should be filed in numerical
order. The most convenient file is a document file, in which contracts
can be filed folded.</p>

<p><b>Collector's Card.</b> The most convenient method of handling
collections is to supply the collector with cards as shown in Fig. 27.
On the face of this card is a record of particulars, similar to that
shown on the outside of the contract, while the reverse is ruled for a
record of payments.</p>

<p>Since all contracts call for payments on certain days of the week
or month, it is very necessary that the collection cards be brought
to notice on the collection days. A simple method of providing for
this is to use a card file equipped with a set of thirty-one numbered
guides to represent the days of the month, or a set of guides printed
with the days of the week. The cards are filed back of the guides
which represent the collection days.</p>

<p>It is customary to divide the city into sections, assigning a collector
to each section, the number depending on the size of the city
and the number of accounts. It is necessary to use as many files as
there are collectors, with an office file added for those who prefer to
pay at the office.</p>

<p>Every morning each collector is given the cards on his route,
on which payments are due. On his return, he turns in all cards to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
the cashier with the amount collected. If a back call is necessary,
the card is filed ahead a day or two.</p>

<p>The cards in the office file are placed on the cashier's desk each
morning and payments are recorded as made. Those on which no
payments are recorded are kept on the desk, and after a reasonable
time are given to a collector to follow up.</p>

<p>When payments have been recorded in the cash book, all cards
are again placed in the files under the next collection dates. They
are then ready for the collectors.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 28. Receipt for Installment Collections</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>Collector's Receipt.</b> Some method is, of course, necessary for
checking up the collectors, and to insure the turning in of all money
collected. A very satisfactory plan has been devised by the cashier
of a western music house, in the form of a duplicate receipt as shown
in Fig. 28. These receipts are bound in book form and numbered
in duplicate, the original being perforated.</p>

<p>The receipt is especially convenient for the customer, as it shows
exactly how the payment is to be credited. For the same reason, it
is equally convenient for the cashier. All of the numbered receipts
must be accounted for; if one is spoiled, it must be turned in, which
provides an effective check on the collector.</p>

<p><b>Mail-Order Installment Collections.</b> An increasing volume of
installment business is now done by mail. An established principle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
of the mail-order business is that customers must be given an opportunity
to inspect the goods before they can be expected to make a
binding contract for their purchases. Beginners in the mail-order
field are quite likely to look on this as an impractical plan, fearing
the loss of goods, but experience soon teaches them that it is the only
plan on which the business can be successfully conducted.</p>

<p>When experienced mail-order men, with the courage to try out
a new idea, experimented on the plan of allowing customers to return
goods, they found that the more liberal the offer, the more business
they did. This led to the giving of an absolute guaranty, offering
to ship goods on approval with the privilege of return for any reason
within certain time limits.</p>

<p>As the fear of loss of goods became less pronounced, it was
argued that more liberal terms of payment could be granted with
safety&mdash;if goods could be sold successfully on the installment plan
to local customers, why not by mail? A trial proved the plan to be
practical, and now many articles are sold by mail on the installment
or easy payment plan. Goods are even shipped without an advance
payment, either the goods or the first payment to be returned within
a certain time limit.</p>

<p>In selling goods by mail on the installment plan, it is necessary
to secure a binding order, in which the customer agrees to return the
goods within a certain number of days, or make the payments as
specified, with an agreement that title to the goods shall be held by
the seller until all payments have been made according to contract.
The contract must also give the seller the right to recall the goods
whenever the customer shall fail to make a single payment as agreed.</p>

<p>The success of the mail-order installment business depends
largely on the manner in which collections are handled. Not having
the advantage of personal contact with the customer, the collector is
obliged to depend on the knowledge of the man which he gains from
references and the correspondence of the customer. But the shrewd
collector soon learns to read his man from the general tone of the
correspondence, and sometimes from the absence of communications
from the debtor. When he has learned the character of the man,
he can handle each account independently; until then, he is obliged
to follow the same line of action in all cases, depending on the law of
averages to prove the correctness of his theories.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-196.jpg" width="400" height="344"

         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 29. Loose-Leaf Ledger for Mail-Order Collections</p>
</div></div>

<p>Too great emphasis cannot be placed on the importance of studying
the character of the man. It is only by paying special attention
to this point that the collector can learn to treat each account individually.
In the first place, the class of goods sold largely governs
the class of customers from a credit standpoint. The men who buy
sets of business books are, as a rule, safe credit risks. Their training
and environment have a tendency to teach them the importance of
fulfilling an obligation; appreciating the necessity of maintaining
their credit standing, they will make every effort to carry out the terms
of the contract, or give a valid reason for asking an extension of time.
Illustrating the opposite extreme is the class who will sign a contract
for the purchase of a cheap musical instrument, at a high price, to
gratify a desire to outdo a neighbor, without regard to their ability
to make the payments as agreed. Such people trust to luck, and
expect to pay in promises if they do not happen to have the money.
For this reason, the percentage of profit that must be added to cover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
the cost of collection increases, as the quality of the goods and the
standard of the credit risk decrease.</p>

<p><b>The Account.</b> Accounts with mail-order installment buyers are
handled in a similar manner to those of local buyers. All contracts
should be numbered as received, and registered in numerical sequence.
The form of register already shown answers the purpose very nicely.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-197.jpg" width="400" height="253"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 30. Mail-Order Collection Card</p>
</div></div>

<p>After registering, the particulars of the contract should be entered
in the ledger. A form of ledger sheet used by a publishing house
is shown in Fig. 29. This is loose-leaf, and does not differ in form
from the ordinary balance ledger, except in the particulars given at the
head of the sheet. Here is shown the name and both residence and
business address of the customer, number of contract, monthly payment
and due date, references, source of order, price and name of
books, and date of shipment. These sheets are filed in post binders,
five-hundred sheets to the binder, and indexed alphabetically.</p>

<p>The next step is to enter the contract on a collection card. A
satisfactory form is shown in Fig. 30. This is a card 4×6 inches
in size, and is practically a duplicate of the ledger sheet. The card
is filed in a chronological file under the due date&mdash;that is, if payments
are due on the 24th of the month the card is filed under that date.
Except when removed from the file for the use of the collector, or to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
enter payments, the card is always filed under the same date. If it
becomes necessary to have an account brought to notice on other than
the regular collection dates, a memo is made on a separate card and
filed in a special tickler.</p>

<p>Should it become necessary to refer to a card on other than the
regular collection dates, reference to the ledger&mdash;indexed alphabetically&mdash;gives
the due date, by which it is quickly located. Sometimes,
however, it is desirable to refer to all contracts in a given territory.
To make this possible, a card file with indexes printed with the
names of states and cities is provided. For each contract a plain 3-×5-inch
index card is used, the name, address, and contract number
only, being entered. This provides a complete set of indexes&mdash;alphabetical
in the ledger; numerical in the register; by due dates
in the collection file; geographical in the card file.</p>

<p>When a payment is received, it is entered in the cash book and
posted to both the ledger and the collection card. Every card must
be located at the time payments are entered in the ledger, or the customer
will very likely receive notices after he has made the payment.</p>

<p><b>The Collection Follow-Up.</b> The promptness of the follow-up
on this class of collections is of the greatest importance&mdash;the debtor
should not be given the excuse that he failed to receive a notice.
Though not provided for in the contract, the debtor expects a notice
of every payment due.</p>

<p>When the goods are shipped, a formal notice of shipment should
be mailed, and if the first payment has not been made, it should be
requested. In ten days, or after the approval time limit has expired,
a second notice should be mailed, provided no payment has been
received. This can be a formal notice, and should assume that the
goods are entirely satisfactory, and at the same time calling attention to
the fact that the first payment is past due. If this does not bring a
remittance within ten days, it is well to send a draft notice. This
notice should go into the conditions of the contract in some detail,
and, without assuming a threatening attitude, it should assume that
if payment is not received within five days it is the desire of the debtor
that a draft be made. Either the notice or the draft will usually
bring the first payment, or the return of the goods.</p>

<p>Each month, a formal statement showing the exact condition of
the account should be mailed a few days before the due date. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
well, on this statement, to
make an offer of a discount
for cash to pay the account in
full. A discount of 5% on an
account that has several
months to run will often be
accepted, and is profitable to
both parties. This statement
should be followed in ten days
by a second notice, also of a
formal nature.</p>

<p>All notices up to this
point may be printed, but further
requests should be in the
form of letters. Except when
it has been found that an account
should be handled in a
special manner, form letters
will be found most satisfactory.
The letters should start out
mild in tone increasing in insistence
as the series is extended.</p>

<p>When persuasion fails,
the debtor should be notified
that the account is being
placed in the hands of an
attorney, or a collection
agency. But before suit is
actually started, it is well to
investigate the probability of
collecting a judgment. If a
man is judgment proof, it is
much better to take the necessary
steps to secure the return
of the goods. This is usually
accomplished by requesting
the express company to call on
the debtor for the package.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>Every debtor has his vulnerable point; if that point is reached,
the money can be collected. The most successful collector is the one
who finds that point in the largest number of cases.</p>

<p><b>Collections by Attorneys.</b> The handling of collections constitutes
an important part of the practice of many attorneys. It would
naturally be supposed that attorneys handling collections for their
clients would have an efficient system of records, but unfortunately
this is not the rule. Except in offices handling a large number of
claims the methods are very lax&mdash;there is an entire absence of a
system that will reveal the exact status of every claim. And yet to
install a system that will give just the information desired is very
simple, and the operation requires less labor than to handle the
claims in a haphazard way.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 32. Attorney's Collection Card</p>
</div></div>

<p>When a claim is received by an attorney, it should be given a
number, and registered in numerical order. The register should be
a book&mdash;either loose-leaf or bound&mdash;with headings for the date received,
names of debtor and creditor, amount of claim, amount collected,
fees, amount remitted, and date remitted or returned, as
shown in Fig. 31. This is not intended as a complete history of the
claim, but merely as a permanent record.</p>

<p>The papers in each claim should be placed in a folder. The
old method was to use a manila jacket or document envelope, to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
filed in a document file. The objectionable feature of this method
is that the papers must be unfolded for reference. A better plan is
to use a correspondence folder, such as is used in the vertical file, in
which the papers can be kept flat.</p>

<p>Whatever style of folder is used, all papers should be fastened&mdash;either
pasted, or by means of a paper fastener. On the outside of
the folder should be written the names of debtor and creditor, and the
number of the claim. The balance of the space on the folder can be
used for recording special information about the claim from time to
time. These claim folders should be filed numerically, according to
claim numbers.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-201.jpg" width="400" height="252"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 33. Back of Attorney's Collection Card</p>
</div></div>

<p>For a convenient record for daily reference, giving a brief history
of the claim, a card is found very satisfactory. The folders are somewhat
bulky and inconvenient for quick reference, and, except in
special cases, it is not necessary to refer to all of the papers. Brief
notes, which can be made on a card, will answer every purpose.</p>

<p>A convenient record form is shown in Fig. 32, which is printed
on a card 4×6 inches in size. This gives the particulars of the
receipt of the claim, the amount, date, and number, with a record of
collections, fees, and remittances. A card is made for each claim,
and filed alphabetically under the name of the debtor. The reverse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
of the card is printed as shown in Fig. 33. This shows the different
steps taken to enforce collection.</p>

<p>The card file provides an index to all debtors against whom
claims are on file, while both the register and the file of folders provide
numerical indexes. But it is the creditor who is the client of the attorney,
and it is very necessary that he be in a position to refer to or
report on all claims received from any client. This necessitates
another index to creditors, which is provided for in the card form
shown in Fig. 34.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 34. Index to Creditors for Attorney</p>
</div></div>

<p>The card is headed with the name and address of the creditor,
below which is a list of all claims filed by him. When a claim is
returned&mdash;paid or unpaid&mdash;the date is entered on this card, so that
the record shows only unpaid claims. These cards are filed alphabetically,
under the names of the creditors.</p>

<p>A follow-up of the claims is provided by a plain index card on
which is written the name of the debtor and number of the claim.
This card is filed in a tickler, under the date on which it is desired to
follow up the claim. This serves as a memorandum only, all records
being made on the claim card or the folder.</p>

<h2 class="p4">THE SHIPPING DEPARTMENT</h2>

<h3 class="p2">INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p>The average manager of a business has but a rudimentary
knowledge of traffic affairs as they relate to the shipment of his goods.
He does not know that he is receiving the lowest rates to which he
is entitled, or that the most favorable classification is applied to his
shipments.</p>

<p>A large percentage&mdash;probably a majority&mdash;of the concerns
which do any considerable amount of shipping, or receive a large
quantity of freight, lose annually in overcharges, due to improper
classifications, defective packing, and a general lack of knowledge
of the subject, a much larger sum than would be required to pay the
salary of a competent traffic manager. There are so many intricate
details to be considered in the shipping problem, that the subject
requires special study, and shippers whose volume of business is
even moderate find it profitable to employ a traffic manager.</p>

<p>Not every shipper is doing a business of sufficient volume to
warrant the employment of a man to devote his entire time to this
question, but, in the organization of every business doing even a
small amount of shipping, there should be one man who will make a
study of traffic matters. He need not have an intimate knowledge
of the entire subject of traffic affairs, but he should be posted on all
questions that have a bearing on the shipment of the goods of his
house. When no regular traffic manager is employed, the duties
of the position fall on the shipping clerk; he is the logical man to
make a study of the subject.</p>

<p>Considered from the standpoint of his knowledge of shipping
requirements, classifications, manner of packing, and the application
of special rates, a man who has had experience in the freight
department of a railroad makes the most successful traffic manager.
Such a man may not be fitted to organize and handle the work of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
the shipping department but, in a concern large enough to require
the services of a traffic manager, there will be work enough to warrant
the employment of an assistant to look after this branch of the
work.</p>

<h3 class="p2">THE SHIPPING CLERK</h3>

<p>In this discussion of the organization of the shipping department,
the shipping clerk will be considered as assuming the duties of
traffic manager, as well as those that usually pertain to his position.
He will be at the head and have full charge of the department, keeping
such records as may be called for by the business.</p>

<p>It is the duty of the shipping clerk to see that all goods are
shipped promptly, packed and described to secure the most favorable
rates, and properly routed. He must have a checking system
that will enable him to locate errors and to know that all goods
called for by an order have been shipped. He will be assisted by
such packers, checkers, and porters as may be required to handle
the work.</p>

<p>The packers will receive the goods called for by an order from
the stock men, and will pack them properly. They will check all
goods packed against the order. In this, they will be assisted by
checkers, who check the goods received on the shipping floor and
again when they are packed. Discrepancies must be reported at
once and adjusted immediately.</p>

<p>In some concerns, the shipping clerk is also the stock clerk, in
which case he has charge of the actual filling of the orders. He is
assisted by stock men, who select the goods and assemble the orders
under his direction.</p>

<p>Like the head of any other department, the shipping clerk should
have full control of his department. No other person in the organization
should be permitted to make shipments. Concerns have been
found in which it was the custom for different employes to ship
small articles without the knowledge of the shipping clerk. Invariably,
this leads to mistakes and results in blame being wrongfully
placed on the shoulders of the shipping clerk. And even greater
damage is done in the disruption of the organization.</p>

<p><b>Information Required.</b> The shipping clerk should be fully
informed on all traffic questions that affect the shipment of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
goods of his house. Of first importance is a knowledge of classifications,
that he may know that his shipments are placed in the lowest
classification to which they are entitled. Copies of the classifications
can be obtained from any local freight office.</p>

<p>In this country there are three principal classifications, these
being the <i>official</i>, governing the eastern territory; <i>western</i>, governing
western territory; <i>southern</i>, governing southern territory. There
are also a few special classifications governing classifications
in certain states. While some attempt at uniform classification
has been made, the several classifications show many variations,
the same article taking different classifications in different
territories.</p>

<p>When classifications are received, they must be carefully studied
by the shipping clerk that he may really understand to what classifications
his goods are entitled. It might be supposed that a certain
article or class of goods would always take the same classification,
but this is not the case; other questions than the name have a bearing
on the question.</p>

<p>The manner of packing goods very often determines the classification.
Certain articles are placed in a lower classification if boxed
than they would be if crated. This is specially true of goods that
are liable to damage in transit. Many shippers make a practice of
crating goods because it can be done more cheaply than boxing,
without realizing that the difference in packing cost is more than
offset by the increase in the freight rate.</p>

<p>The classification is also sometimes determined by the manner
in which the goods are described. It is necessary, therefore, to study
the classifications with reference to the description that will insure
the most favorable rate. However, false descriptions made for the
purpose of securing a lower classification must be avoided, as the
Interstate Commerce Act provides a heavy penalty for such falsification.
But there may be several different descriptions which legitimately
apply to a given article, each placing it in a different class.
A case in point: The western classification made no provision for
filing cabinets in carload lots, with the result that a carload shipment,
described as filing cabinets, took the rate provided for less
than carload lots. But the same classification gave a lower classification,
consequently a lower rate, on office furniture in carload lots.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
Filing cabinets being office furniture, it was entirely legitimate to
describe such shipments as office furniture.</p>

<p>Another illustration of the effect of description on the classification
is found in shipments of carriages. The classification, and consequent
rate, on this commodity is based on the space that it will
require, rather than on the rate. If shipped knocked down and
properly crated, with the dimensions stated on the shipping bill, a
carriage takes a lower classification than if shipped assembled, or
if the dimensions of the crate are omitted.</p>

<p>These illustrations are sufficient to show the importance of a
thorough knowledge of the provisions of the different classifications.
The shipping clerk who would give the best service to his house
should make a study of this subject, even if he is obliged to take the
classifications home and study them at night. Every shipper should
see that his shipping clerk is supplied with copies of classifications
governing the territory in which he is doing business, and give him
an opportunity to learn their provisions in respect to the commodities
which he ships.</p>

<p><b>Class Rates.</b> A <i>class rate</i>, as the name implies, is one based on
the classification. All commodities are divided into classes, six in
number, and all commodities of the same class&mdash;with certain exceptions,
explained later&mdash;take the same rate. Schedules of rates between
given points, based on the class, are prepared by the classification
committees, but before being put into effect, they must, in case
they apply between points in different states, be submitted to the
Interstate Commerce Commission for approval. While not a <i>rate-making</i>
body, the commission is a <i>rate-governing</i> body, constituting,
in a certain sense, a board of arbitration between shippers and transportation
companies.</p>

<p>The rates being based on the classes&mdash;the higher the class, the
higher the rate. To determine the rate, it is first necessary to find
the classification; reference to the rate schedule will show the rate
for each class.</p>

<p><b>Commodity Rates.</b> A commodity rate is one applying to a
special commodity, between definitely stated points. Commodity
rates are established by the railroads to meet some special condition,
and with these the classification committees have nothing to do.</p>

<p>A commodity rate does not apply to articles not named in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
tariff even though they are of a similar nature, nor do they apply
between points not specified in the special tariff. A commodity rate
is, in effect, a special rate; it offers special inducements for the shipment
of certain commodities, but is not intended to favor any one
shipper. The commodity rate is for the benefit of all shippers of the
commodity named.</p>

<p>The volume of traffic is the chief factor in establishing rates,
either regular or special. It is an especially important factor in
establishing a commodity rate. In a given community, some one
commodity may be produced in large quantities. Perhaps it is a
raw material which must be transported to certain manufacturing
centers. To encourage the development of the industry, thereby
creating a large volume of traffic, the railroads leading from the
point where the traffic originates establish a commodity rate to other
points, where the raw material can be used to advantage by the
manufacturer. Or, perhaps, important manufacturers are located
on other roads, in which case connecting lines join with the originating
road and issue what is known as a <i>joint tariff</i>. This enables the producer
to deliver his raw material to the manufacturer on favorable
terms, when to pay class rates might compel him to abandon the enterprise,
with a consequent loss of traffic to the railroads. This
discriminates against no one, since every shipper of the particular
commodity between the points named is entitled to the special commodity
rate.</p>

<p>Frequently, however, a commodity rate exists between certain
points which might, under certain conditions, be taken advantage
of by a shipper located at a point outside of those named in the
commodity tariff. For illustration, a manufacturer in Peoria, Illinois,
is shipping a commodity on which a special rate is granted between
Chicago and Milwaukee, but takes a class rate from the point of
shipment. He makes a shipment to Milwaukee and pays the through
class rate provided from the point of shipment, when by proper billing
he would have paid the class rate to Chicago, and secured the
benefit of the commodity rate from that point to Milwaukee. A
lack of knowledge of commodity rates in effect in the manufacturer's
territory has resulted in an unnecessary expense&mdash;a loss of money.</p>

<p>The claim might be made that the billing clerk at the local
freight office should have given the shipper the benefit of the lowest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
rate. But he will fall back on the classification and be prepared to
show that he has given the only rate quoted on shipments from
Peoria to Milwaukee, which is the class rate. It is no part of his
duties to keep posted on commodity rates granted by another road,
while it is distinctly to the interest of the manufacturer to know of
the existence of all such rates applying to his product.</p>

<p><b>Freight Tariffs.</b> The Interstate Commerce Act provides that
two copies of every freight tariff issued by the railroads shall be placed
on file at each freight office, for the inspection of the public. Since
the rates must be made public, the railroads do not object to supplying
shippers with copies of the tariffs applying to their product.
Through the local freight agent, copies of all tariffs applying from
the point of shipment can be obtained.</p>

<p>It has been shown that, in the case of commodity rates, copies
of tariffs from the point of shipment are not always sufficient. It is
necessary to obtain, from connecting lines reaching the territory in
which the trade of the house lies, copies of all special tariffs applying
to the commodities shipped. The freight departments of all
railroads, through their solicitors, make a practice of supplying
copies of all regular and special tariffs to all large shippers on their
lines, and to shippers on connecting lines who are in a position to
divert traffic to them. Any shipper who has been overlooked, should
write to the freight departments of all lines in his territory asking to
be placed on the mailing list to receive copies of all tariffs affecting
his product. By doing this, he will secure copies of all such tariffs
as soon as issued.</p>

<p>The subject of commodity rates is one of the most vexing with
which the shipping clerk has to deal, as it is also one of the most important.
To compile a complete file of special tariffs, involves close
study and much labor. But when once done, it can be kept up-to-date
with little difficulty, and the saving resulting will far outweigh
the cost.</p>

<p><b>Filing Tariffs.</b> The manner in which freight tariffs coming
into the office are filed is important, for unless properly filed and
indexed they are likely to be of little value. The filing system must
provide for quickly locating any tariff, and for locating all tariffs
that may have a bearing on a particular case.</p>

<p>In the average shipping clerk's office, it is not uncommon to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
find the tariffs dumped into a drawer, without regard to their order,
or hung on a hook on the wall. When a rate is wanted, it is necessary
to search through the tariffs until one giving the rate is found. The
chances are that the first rate found will be used, regardless of the
fact that another tariff shows a special and lower rate.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-211.jpg" width="400" height="291"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 1. Vertical File of Indexed Folders for Railroad Tariffs</p>
</div></div>

<p>A very satisfactory file for freight tariffs is the vertical file, and
one drawer will hold all of the tariffs required by the average shipper.
If a two-drawer cabinet is provided, the shipping clerk will usually
find other uses for the extra drawer.</p>

<p>Each railroad whose tariffs are on file should be assigned a
folder, and the folders should be filed alphabetically under the names
of the railroads, as shown in Fig. 1. All tariffs from one railroad
should be filed in the folder assigned to that road, and arranged
according to their numbers. All railroads number their tariffs and,
in correspondence, refer to them by number. Reference to the tariffs
will be facilitated, therefore, if those of each railroad are kept in
numerical sequence.</p>

<p>Loose-leaf binders are sometimes used for filing tariffs, but not
all tariffs are in proper shape for punching to fit the binder. Another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
disadvantage in using a loose-leaf binder is that freight tariffs are not
uniform in size, resulting in an awkward, unwieldy book. For these
reasons, the vertical file is found more satisfactory.</p>

<p><b>The Index.</b> Since the tariff folders are filed in alphabetical
sequence, no index is required to locate the tariffs of a given road,
but a cross-index to locate all tariffs that apply to a given point, is a
necessity. This index should be in card form, a card being used for
each town to which the house ships, or is likely to ship, its products.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-212.jpg" width="400" height="295"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 2. Cross-Index to Tariff File</p>
</div></div>

<p>A very satisfactory form of card for this cross-index is shown
in Fig. 2, which also shows the manner of filing. At the head of the
card is the name of the town, and the name of the railroad on which
it is located. Below the heading, the first column shows the names
of all railroads issuing tariffs to the town in question, whether or not
the town is located on the road. Following this are columns for the
number of the tariff and for either commodity or class rates. These
cards are filed in the same manner as the tariff folders&mdash;alphabetically
by names of the railroads. A guide card is provided for each road
and all cards representing towns on that road are filed in alphabetical
order behind the guide card.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-213.jpg" width="400" height="236"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 3. Card for Class Rates</p>
</div></div>

<p>Suppose a rate is wanted from a point on the Delaware, Lackawana
&amp; Western, to a point on the Burlington. Reference to the
Burlington tariffs does not give the rate, for the reason that the Burlington
does not issue tariffs from points on the D. L. &amp; W., but
reference to the card shows that four roads issue tariffs from Buffalo
to Burlington points, one of them being a commodity tariff. Reference
to the commodity tariff shows that the special rate applies from
a point in Ohio to Chicago, a connecting point with the Burlington.
By proper routing, this special rate can be taken advantage of, class
rates applying the balance of the distance. Without the index, it
would be necessary to look through several folders, with the possibility
that the special tariff might be overlooked.</p>

<p><b>Condensed Rate File.</b> A condensed rate file covering a definite
territory will prove a convenience to most shippers. The trade of
most houses is confined to a certain definite and rather limited territory.
A manufacturer may make an occasional shipment to a
point outside of his regular territory, but, as a rule, his shipments
will be confined within certain limits. This is even more true of
the jobber and the wholesaler.</p>

<p>If a special rate file, covering the particular territory in which
the shipper's trade lies, is prepared, it will be found convenient for
reference, and will save consulting the tariff files whenever a rate is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
wanted. Such a file can be arranged on cards, or in a small loose-leaf
book. One card or sheet should be used for each town, the name
of the town being written at the head of the card.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-214.jpg" width="400" height="239"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 4. Card Index for Classifications</p>
</div></div>

<p>The card should show the rates for all classes from the shipping
point to the destination, as well as the route. It may be necessary to
record rates from more than one shipping point. A manufacturer
may have two or more shipping points, and it is important to know
from which points he can secure the most favorable rates. It is
also advisable to include the shipping points of the chief competitors,
that they may be given due consideration in meeting competition.</p>

<p>Fig. 3 shows the form of card for this rate file. The cards
should be filed alphabetically, and it is well to include cards for some
of the principal towns outside of, but convenient to, the regular territory.
The rates for the different classes, rather than on specific
articles, are given for the reason that the classification is more likely
to change than the rate. If the rate on a certain article is given,
and the classification of that article is given, should the classification
of that article be changed, it would be necessary to rewrite the entire
index. It is much less difficult to change the record of the classification
of one article than to revise all of the rates.</p>

<p><b>Classification Index.</b> For convenient reference, the shipping
clerk should prepare an index showing the classification of all articles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
that he is obliged to ship. This classification index should be on
cards or in loose leaf, whichever is used for the rate file. One sheet
is used for each article, the name of the article being written at the top.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-215.jpg" width="400" height="230"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 5. Card for Commodity Rates</p>
</div></div>

<p>The record should show how the article is packed, the class,
and the classification in which it is found. As has been stated, more
than one class may apply to a given article, depending on the manner
of packing; an article may take the first-class rate if boxed, or double
first-class if crated. In such cases, both classes with the manner
of packing should be shown.</p>

<p>These classification sheets should be filed alphabetically in the
file used for the rate cards, and they should be printed on stock of a
different color. Most shippers will need but a few of these sheets
as the number of articles shipped by one house is small, as a rule.
If a large number of articles is shipped, the classification index is of
even greater importance. A suitable form for this index is shown in
Fig. 4.</p>

<p><b>Commodity=Rate File.</b> When any part of the goods shipped are
subject to commodity rates, a file of commodity rates is fully as important
as class rates. A commodity-rate file is arranged on similar
lines to the file of class rates. A card or sheet is used for each town
to which commodity rates apply, and the cards are filed alphabetically
by names of towns. These cards can be filed with the class rates,
but a distinctive color should be used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>The record should give the names of the articles taking commodity
rates, manner of packing, the point from which the rate
applies, the rate, the number of the tariff, and the name of the issuing
railroad. On the line below the name of the town appears the
caption, <i>see also</i>. This is for the name of some other point to which
a commodity rate applies. Boone, Iowa, for instance, may not
be a commodity point, though a special rate from Chicago to Clinton
is in effect. The Boone card would refer to Clinton, and the card
for that town would show the rate. Fig. 5 shows a form for commodity
rates.</p>

<p>To compile such a record of rates as has been described, requires
an initial expenditure of much labor, but is a profitable investment.
When once compiled, changes can be recorded with little trouble.
These files will always be valuable for reference, not alone to the shipping
clerk but to the sales manager and the purchasing agent as well.</p>

<p>A comprehensive knowledge of classifications and rates will
prove valuable not only to the shipper, but to the receiver of freight.
It will save any merchant many dollars in freight charges on goods
purchased f. o. b. point of shipment. The shipper may not pack
his goods in a manner to secure the lowest rate, or he may not give
the proper description in the shipping bill. If his attention is called
to the matter by a customer, he probably will make the necessary
changes in his methods.</p>

<p>Even the proprietor of a small retail business will find a study
of this subject a paying investment. The writer has knowledge of
a case in which the owner of a general store saved some $165.00 in
one year by carefully checking every freight bill received, making
claims for overcharges, and watching the packing and routing of
his goods. Surely that amount would be worth saving, even to a
house transacting a much larger volume of business.</p>

<p><b>Routing Shipments.</b> One of the most important duties of the
shipping clerk is the proper routing of his shipments. Like classifications
and rates, the subject requires careful study. In too many
cases this subject receives little attention, but by exercising care in
routing shipments, the shipping clerk can be of material assistance to
the sales department, and, incidentally, to the customers of his house.</p>

<p>Routing frequently affects the rate. It might appear logical to
suppose that the rate between two given points would be the same,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
regardless of the route; but this is not the case. Of two routes to a
given point, one may be longer than the other. If shipping and
destination points happen to be in different states, the provision of
the Interstate Commerce Act which forbids a higher rate for a short
haul than for a long haul comes into play. Similar provisions applying
to local shipments, are found in the laws of certain states. In
Iowa, for instance, such a provision covers the transportation of
passengers as well as freight. One railroad is not permitted to meet
the competition of another having a shorter route between two points,
but must base its rate on the mileage. All of which goes to show the
necessity of considering the length of the haul in routing shipments.</p>

<p>The above conditions apply especially to shipments taking class
rates, but when goods which take commodity rates are to be shipped,
the question of routing is of even greater importance. It has been
shown that a commodity rate may be in effect between two points
on one road, or two or more roads may have issued a joint tariff
which can be taken advantage of. The question of commodity rates,
therefore, has a most important bearing on the routing of shipments.</p>

<p>Another factor that has a bearing on the routing is <i>basing points</i>,
which necessitates a knowledge of the points on which rates are based.
In the territories governed by the different classifications, certain
common points are used for basing rates. On shipments from the
central states to southern territory, rates are based on Ohio River
points, while, to western territory, they are, in many cases, based on
Missouri River points. Class rates from Chicago to all Missouri
River points are, as a rule, the same over all roads, but, to points
beyond the Missouri River, rates may vary from the different basing
points; that is, the rate from Omaha to a western point may be less
than from Kansas City, though the rate to these basing points is the
same.</p>

<p>The alert shipping clerk will learn the basing points in the
territory to which he is shipping goods&mdash;which he can do by consulting
local freight officials&mdash;and will then secure tariffs from these
basing points to the towns he wishes to reach. This information he
will incorporate in his rate files.</p>

<p>Not least of the factors which should be considered in routing
shipments, is the accommodation of the customer. It is frequently
the case, that of two roads entering a town, the freight house of one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
is more conveniently located for the shipper. Rates being equal,
shipments should be routed over the road from which the customer's
cartage charges are the lowest. Or the customer may have a sidetrack
to his warehouse from one road, which makes no switching
charge, while on every car shipped over another road a switching
charge must be paid. This charge may offset an advantage in rates.
It always pays to accommodate the customer. When the wishes of
the customer are known, they should be granted, within reasonable
limits, even though it involves extra expense.</p>

<h3 class="p2">FILLING ORDERS</h3>

<p>In all large concerns the filling of orders&mdash;that is, the assembling
of the goods&mdash;is done by the stock department. The subject is here
discussed in connection with the shipping department for the reason
that in many houses all orders are assembled under the direction of
the shipping clerk; in others he is also the stock keeper or stores clerk.</p>

<p>This discussion refers more especially to the filling of orders in
a jobbing house, or a manufacturing business which carries goods in
stock. It does not refer to those manufacturing enterprises whose
orders are for goods to be manufactured.</p>

<p>As a rule, all orders of a jobbing house should be filled the day
they are received. If they cannot be filled complete, they should be
filled as nearly as possible, and missing articles handled as explained
later under the subject of <i>Back Orders</i>.</p>

<p>There is a great chance for time saving in most houses in filling
orders. In many houses, too little consideration is given to the handling
of goods in a manner that will save time in assembling orders.
Lack of a logically planned system is responsible for much of the confused
and confusing rush in the average shipping room, about the
time that orders should be delivered to the transportation companies.</p>

<p>Here is a case in point which came under the observation of the
writer. A certain jobbing house, handling drugs and druggists'
sundries, occupied a five-story building. On each floor there was
a stock room in charge of a stock man, who, with the aid of such
helpers as he needed, kept the stock in proper shape, and assembled
the goods required from his floor to fill orders.</p>

<p>In the drug business, the average order received from a retailer
calls for a large number of articles&mdash;it is made up of small items.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
This is especially true of orders brought in by the traveling salesmen.
As a consequence, the larger part of the orders received by
this house called for goods from practically every floor.</p>

<p>The custom was to send orders first to the floor farthest from
the shipping room&mdash;that is, to the fifth floor. The stock man assembled
the goods required from his floor, placed them in a basket
with the order, and sent them down to the fourth floor. Each order
went from floor to floor and finally reached the shipping room&mdash;perhaps
being held an hour on one floor for a single article because
of other orders ahead.</p>

<p>A result of this method was that, in the morning, the stock
men on the upper floors were rushed, while those on the lower floors
had no orders to fill, except those calling for goods from one floor
only. In the afternoon, the conditions were reversed. Then the
men on the upper floors had nothing to do but put their stocks in
shape; those on the lower floors were busy filling orders. These
conditions were not particularly objectionable so far as the stock
men were concerned, as they were profitably employed, when not
filling orders, in caring for their stocks; but in the shipping room
great confusion resulted. Goods required to fill the day's orders did
not begin to come into the shipping room until late in the day, and
then they came with a rush. Hurried packing resulted in mistakes,
caused disputes, and lost good customers.</p>

<p>To overcome the difficulty, a new plan which worked admirably
was perfected. A chart was prepared, along the lines of the one
shown in Fig. 6. On this chart, a section was set aside for each
floor, and in the first column the classes of goods stored on each
floor were listed. In the next two columns a few of the articles
in each class&mdash;enough to serve as a guide&mdash;were listed, and the last
column showed the floor <i>B</i>, meaning the basement. On this chart,
the location of any class of goods could be seen at a glance, and in
case of doubt about the class to which an article belonged, reference
to the catalogue issued by the firm gave the desired information.</p>

<p>A copy of the chart was given to the order clerk, who entered
all orders on a billing typewriter. In entering the order all articles
were grouped by floors, starting at the fifth floor. Below the list of
articles from each floor a space was left, the first entry for the next
floor being on the second line below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-220.jpg" width="400" height="669"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 6. Floor Chart for the Classification of Stock</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>Two copies of the order were provided for the use of the shipping
clerk. When the orders reached his desk, he cut one copy into parts,
as represented by the floors from which goods were to come. After
entering the order number on the margin of each, he sent these sections
to the stock men. Each man assembled the goods required from
his floor and sent them, with his section of the order blank, directly
to the shipping room. Here they were checked against the shipping
clerk's copy of the order, and, as soon as all sections had been filled,
the order was ready for packing. This resulted in distributing the
work more evenly, and kept the goods coming regularly to the shipping
room.</p>

<p>Another method of accomplishing the same result is to make
as many copies of the order as there are floors, the complete order
being sent to each stock man, who fills only his part. An advantage
of dividing the order sheet, as explained, is that the stock men
have no knowledge of the names of customers. This prevents a
stock man from taking a list of the firm's customers to another house&mdash;an
occurrence which is not entirely unknown.</p>

<p><b>Back Orders.</b> Most concerns find it impossible to fill all orders
completely; there are occasional shortages in every house. In such
cases, it is the usual custom to fill all orders as nearly as possible,
and forward the items that are short as soon as they are in stock,
or with a later shipment.</p>

<p>The possibility of these items being overlooked must be provided
against, and this is done by entering all items that are short
on a new order. This is known as a <i>back order</i>. The back order
should be made in duplicate and should be printed on stock of some
distinctive color that will not be confused with the regular order
blanks. For convenience in filing, it should also be made the same
size as the regular orders.</p>

<p>If the number of back orders is very large, a separate series of
order numbers is used, but most concerns do not have a sufficient
number of such orders to make this necessary. The more usual
custom is to give the back order the same number as the original of
which it is a part.</p>

<p>Of the two copies of the back order, one goes to the shipping
clerk, while the other is kept in the office. The office copy is used
to follow up the shipment of the order. It is necessary for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
shipping clerk to know immediately when goods required to fill
back orders are received. When a separate receiving clerk is employed,
the back order is sometimes made in triplicate, one copy for
the receiving clerk, who notifies the shipping clerk when the goods
arrive.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-222.jpg" width="400" height="341"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 7. Back-Order Blank</p>
</div></div>

<p>When a back order is filled, the shipping clerk returns his copy
to the office. Invoices are made in duplicate, one copy being filed
as a sales sheet. The two copies of the order are filed with the
corresponding copies of the original order. A most satisfactory plan
is to file one copy numerically and one alphabetically, making a cross-index.
A simple form of back-order blank is shown in Fig. 7.</p>

<h3 class="p2">CHECKING SHIPMENTS</h3>

<p>One of the vitally important problems in connection with shipping
is the proper checking of items in each shipment. To receive complaints
of shortages is very annoying to the shipper&mdash;especially so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
when he is not in position to prove that the items claimed to be
short were shipped&mdash;but, rather than take the chance of losing a
customer, he usually pockets the loss.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-223.jpg" width="400" height="336"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 8. Order Blank with Column for Shipper's Check</p>
</div></div>

<p>Shipments should be checked at every stage in the process of
filing the order, by everyone who handles the goods. The stock
man should check his part of the order as he assembles the goods,
and again before he forwards them to the shipping room, or the
next floor. When received in the shipping room, the goods should
be checked against the shipping clerk's order, and again just before
they are packed.</p>

<p>It should be a positive rule that all goods shall be checked
when they are placed in the cases. The items should be called off
by the packer as he handles them, and checked on the order by a
checker. This is a safer plan than calling off the items from the
order, as it insures a positive check on the items actually packed&mdash;not
what should have been packed. All order blanks should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
provided with a separate column in which to check the items
actually shipped, and quantities should be entered in this column
even if the order is shipped in full. The checking column on the
order blank is shown in Fig. 8. If the system of entering orders
includes a copy to be used as an invoice, the items are entered in this
column after the shipping order is returned to the office.</p>

<p>The initials or numbers of both packer and checker should
appear on the shipping order. It is also a good plan to place in each
case a packer's slip, shown in Fig. 9, giving the number or initials
of the packer and instructing the
customer to return the slip with
any claim for shortage or damaged
goods. In some houses, it is
the custom to make the packer's
slip a duplicate of the order,
listing all items packed, in which
case, it makes a convenient receiving
slip for the customer.</p>

<div class="floatleft">

         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 9. Packer's Slip</p>
</div></div>

<p>While not offering positive
insurance against mistakes, a
thorough checking system will
reduce errors in packing to a
minimum, and will most certainly
pay for the labor involved. In large houses shipping a large number
of packages over several different railroads, a further complication
arises through the liability of deliveries being made to the wrong
freight house. Where several hundred shipments per day are made,
it is not uncommon for a teamster to leave a package at the wrong
road, finding himself short on his deliveries at another road; or the
mistake may be made in loading the drays.</p>

<p>One well-known mail-order house has overcome the difficulty
in a simple manner. This house is shipping several hundred packages
a day by freight, over eight railroads. The basis of their shipping
system is a color scheme, each railroad being designated by a different
color&mdash;that is, the New York Central is represented by green, the
Erie by blue, etc.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>The shipping floor is divided into sections, one for each railroad,
and one for each express company. The low partitions that
separate the sections are painted in the colors representing the railroads,
and over each is a sign bearing the name of the road, also
printed in the corresponding color. All packages are taken directly
from the packing room to the sections of the shipping floor representing
the roads over which they are to be shipped.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 10. Routing Package Labels</p>
</div></div>

<p>In all blanks used in shipping, the same color scheme is carried
out. This includes shipping orders, packing orders, invoices, shipping
receipts, and labels. All orders are properly routed before
they are distributed to the billing machine operators for entry. Each
operator enters orders for certain railroads&mdash;from one to three, depending
on the distribution of the trade&mdash;and is supplied with blanks of
proper color for those roads only. Every order is then entered on
blanks of the color representing the railroad over which the shipment
is routed.</p>

<p>In Fig. 10 is shown a label which represents this color scheme.
Across the end of the label is a solid block of color, with the name
of the road in an open letter. All printing on the label is also of the
same color. If the order is properly routed and entered, there is
very little chance for shipments to go astray. On every blank and
on the package itself, the color of the road is a prominent feature,
and since all blanks are written at the same time, they must correspond.
Should a package be placed in the wrong section, it is practically
certain that the error will be discovered when the goods are
loaded on the dray.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="p2">EXPORT SHIPPING</h3>

<p>Export shipping is a subject about which the average American
house knows but little, and herein appears to lie the cause of the loss
of much foreign trade. This is especially true of trade with other than
English-speaking countries. But the real fault lies farther back than
in the shipping department.</p>

<p>The trouble starts in the sales department. Export business is
undertaken without special preparation, and an attempt is made to
apply the methods used in handling domestic trade. Special instructions
in regard to packing, for instance, are ignored because the
American thinks he knows more than his customer in a foreign land.</p>

<p>Before export business is even attempted, the sales department
should become thoroughly familiar with conditions in the country
with which it wishes to do business. Some man in the department
should study the customs regulations, the descriptions necessary,
the kind of packing needed, and the size of package best adapted to
the country. Above all, he must study the desires of the trade, and
conform to them, if he expects to make and hold customers.</p>

<p>Special importance is attached to the question of packing and
describing the goods. No matter how unreasonable the request of
the customer or the foreign salesman may seem, it should be complied
with, for it is made for some good reason. A request of a merchant
in Omaha, ordering dry goods from Chicago, that goods ordinarily
packed in a large case be packed in small oblong boxes, might very
properly be ignored; but not so if the customer is located in a South
American republic. There, if the goods are to go to the interior,
they must be transported over the mountains on the backs of pack
mules.</p>

<p>Besides making the packages of suitable size, goods for export
must be packed to withstand hard usage, and must be well protected
against the elements. Goods must be fully and accurately described
in order that they may pass the custom house. The dimensions
of each package must be shown on the shipping bills, for freight
rates are based on the space occupied in the hold of the ship, rather
than on weight.</p>

<p>In a recent address on trade conditions in the Latin-American
countries, Wm. Harley Porter, Deputy Captain of the Port of Cienfuegos,
during the occupation of Cuba by the United States government,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
made some very pertinent suggestions on these questions, some
of which are published by permission&mdash;as follows:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">To secure South American trade, we must first train salesmen.
They must make an exhaustive study of the different South American
tariffs and at least know Spanish. They must be willing to accept instructions
as to shipping, and be powerful enough to insist that they be
carried out literally. And it would be a good thing for them to take a
kindergarten course in carpentry and blacksmithing, so that they would
not continue the stupid, expensive blunders of American houses in the
packing of goods.</p>

<p class="pbq">I don't know how to drive that last statement home hard enough.
Our consuls plead with our exporters, and our Government distributes
volumes freely on the subject, yet there is no apparent improvement.</p>

<p class="pbq">I confess that until I had some first-hand experience, I supposed
that the packing evil was a convenient sort of filler, with which Consuls
padded their reports for want of better material.</p>

<p class="pbq">In order to fit out the custom house of Cienfuegos, Cuba, with new
office furniture, we placed an order amounting to nearly one thousand
dollars with a Chicago house that brazenly advertised that it made a
specialty of export business. Their booklet was encouraging, and the
prices really low. So we ordered roll-top and flat-top desks, cashier's
desks, office chairs, tables and card cabinets, and then worried, for fear
that the goods would not arrive before the end of the fiscal year, then
rapidly approaching, in which event, our furniture appropriation would
revert to the island treasury.</p>

<p class="pbq">Six weeks from the day the order reached Chicago, the goods left
New York&mdash;time enough to have had them come from Hawaii. With
the goods came a single invoice. The vouchers in triplicate, which must
be filled properly before the account can be paid by a governmental
department, had been thrown aside as of no use. To protect the
exporter, a voucher was drawn, for the ship reached port on June 30, the
last day of the fiscal year. Several dollars were wasted in cable messages
to expedite the return of new invoices, and the goods were unpacked.</p>

<p class="pbq">Not one piece of furniture, save a few chairs, was found whole.
No American, in the States, would have accepted the goods. We had
paid for them. A letter of remonstrance brought back a churlish answer,
written in a cocky American spirit of superiority, to the effect that possibly
some one outside could tell that house something about packing their
own goods, but they would be greatly surprised to meet such a person.</p>

<p class="pbq">The trouble lay in the thinness of the packing cases. Goods are
loaded into a ship by casting a rope sling about their middle, by which
they are hoisted up and let down, often with a run, into the hold. Our
desks, without sufficient outer protection and not being built on the principle
of a truss bridge, naturally collapsed. The cases were none too good
for a railway journey, and were certain to be damaged at any Central
or South American port because, in nearly every case, unloading is done
from the ship to a lighter, and from the lighter, by main strength and
awkwardness, to a wharf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq">I cannot recall one instance in which American houses carried out
instructions literally. I believe that there is a great future for an American
exporter who will let the man on the ground do his own thinking, and take
it for granted that he knows what he wants and how he wants it. The
exasperation of a man who is weeks or months away from the markets,
and who finds that substitution has been practiced, or his goods so packed
that destruction was plainly invited, cannot be adequately described by
a man on my income.</p>

<p class="pbq">We bought a typewriter in New York, one time, for two reasons:
We could get the liberal discount, allowed the government if we bought
direct from the maker, and we could evade a 25% duty if we received it
through our custom house and not through another. Also there was a
line of steamers from New York to our wharf.</p>

<p class="pbq">Some five weeks after placing the order, we were notified by an
express company in Havana that it had accepted for our account a typewriter,
and that when the duty, plus accrued express and forwarding
charges, amounting to $45.O3, were paid, it would be dispatched in our
direction.</p>

<p class="pbq">We were out $40.03 because some fool shipping clerk had insisted
on trying to do our heavy thinking. We had given him the name of the
steamer by which the machine was to be shipped, but he had discovered, in
some way, that steamships will not make a bill for less than a metric ton.
That, he doubtless learned, would cost us $5.00. The package only weighed
about 30 lbs., so he started it off by express. His brain did not carry far
enough for him to learn that only one American express company crossed
the Florida Strait and naturally chance took it to another company.
Two changes were made in express companies before the box reached the
coast and the package sauntered about in our beautiful Southland for
more than a month before it landed in Havana.</p>

<p class="pbq">Had any Spanish merchant been subjected to the invariable annoyance
which fell to our lot when we endeavored to patronize American
houses, he would have given up in despair and remembered the adage of
the burnt child, forever.</p>

<p class="pbq">And, unfortunately, the carelessness of American shippers often
costs the foreign merchants good, hard dollars. Tariffs in Latin-American
republics are fearfully and wonderfully made, and there is nothing
that a pin-headed government employe enjoys more than inflicting a fine
for a slip in complying with a little red tape.</p>

<p class="pbq">Here is a case in point. A large house in Mexico City bought a
carload of chairs over here, and with the order sent the shipping forms
prescribed by the Mexican government. A very explicit letter was sent
also, saying that consular invoices would be provided by their custom
house broker in Laredo, who would receive the goods at the border, but
that the shipping forms must be filled out, each package numbered with
a serial number on the forms. Full description involved, of course, a
statement as to the kind of wood used, so that the duty might be easily
adjusted.</p>

<p class="pbq">The goods, however, were simply consigned as so many bundles
of chairs, weight so much. The shipping lists were ignored. The innocent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
receiver of those goods was fined both because they had not been
properly described and because the weight was grossly understated.
It cost the Mexican house $800 and when the American was asked to settle
the charges caused by carelessness, or pig-headedness, he merely answered
that he was not going to settle any bills with the Mexican government.</p>

<p class="pbq">The Mexican firm settled&mdash;it had to&mdash;and posted every importer
in the republic in the matter, so that not only will that American house
not sell any more chairs in Mexico, but Americans generally have been
given another black eye.</p>

<p class="pbq">There is a good reason for careful custom regulations, and the
exporter should know that they are partly for his protection. For instance,
they usually require that a certain number, generally ten per
cent, of all packages shall be opened and compared with the shipping list.
If these packages, chosen at random, are correct, the consignment is delivered.
But if any variation is found, fraud is assumed, and every package
is thoroughly examined, usually with more or less damage.</p>

<p class="pbq">It is customary for English and German firms, in the packing of
small articles, to use different colored pasteboard boxes, which are often
decorated with pictures indicating the contents. For instance, in a large
packing case containing a stock of gentlemen's furnishings, all collars will
be in boxes of one color, socks in another, cravats in another, etc. The
large case is lined with tin, by the way, and after packing, the tin joints
are soldered around the top. Here is the English system: First, the
small boxes, individualized as much as possible; then heavy wrapping
paper, then a tin lining inside of an outer wooden casing, the latter being
well made and reinforced with iron straps. Last of all, directions and
addresses are stenciled in large, clear block letters. The Germans often
use oiled paper between the tin and the inner packages, so that even if the
tin is punctured, the oiled paper will resist the sea air, which invariably
injures delicate fabrics.</p>

<p class="pbq">The American idea seems to be to put as much as possible in a large,
thin box or a poorly bound bale. The European, whose agents study
conditions on the ground, knows that much interior transportation in
Latin America is packed by pack mule, and therefore uses medium-sized
oblong boxes, two of which make a good load.</p>

<p class="pbq">I cannot emphasize too strongly the necessity for careful description
of goods to pass them through a custom house with the least inconvenience.
Mixed consignments must pay the highest duty assessed
against anything found in a lump or poorly described quantity. If you
deal in bolts, for instance, you may not merely say <i>1,000, 3×2×⅜ bolts</i>,
but you should say whether they are cotton, linen, or woolen. They have
to know, before they can assess duty.</p>

<p class="pbq">Instead of a ringing peroration about American pluck, progressiveness,
and other non-essentials, let me give you some shipping rules, if
you are going to have a try for South American trade.</p>

<p class="pbq">Secure shipping list forms beforehand and find out if consular
invoices are needed.</p>

<p class="pbq">Pack your goods in small packages, for you will pay freight on metric
tons and they are based on cubic measure and not on weight.</p>

<p class="pbq"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq">Pack well, for tons of stuff will probably lie on your cases.</p>

<p class="pbq">Give each package a serial number and describe it by that number,
on the shipping forms.</p>

<p>If your goods can be damaged by sea water, use tin-lined cases.</p>

<p class="pbq">Your invoices should show not only number, measurement, and
exact contents of each package, but their gross, tare, and net weight,
for in many cases the container must pay the same duty as the contents.</p>

<p class="pbq">Be sure that your forwarding agent is reliable, for the law allows
him many charging privileges if you are careless in providing for contingencies.</p>

<p class="pbq">Contract, if you can, for through transportation and get from the
transportation companies the requisite export manifests to accompany
shipment.</p>

<p class="pbq">Make triplicate invoices, one to accompany the goods and two to
be mailed to the consignee. One of these will be turned over to the
custom officials, so in case the invoice sent with the goods fails to come
through, and that often happens, the triplicate can be accepted. Without
an invoice your goods cannot leave the ship, and I know of cases where
cargoes have been held awaiting invoices for eight weeks.</p>

<p class="pbq">And, in conclusion, remember that sentiment is not the foundation
for foreign trade. If we sell abroad we must do so on merit and by
foreign systems&mdash;not our own.</p>


<h3 class="p2">FREIGHT CLAIMS</h3>

<p>Freight claims are an ever present source of annoyance. Every
shipper, and practically every receiver, of freight finds it necessary
to make claims against the railroads for freight overcharges, shortages,
and damages to goods in transit. Some houses find occasion
to make but one or two claims a year; others constantly have several
claims on file, aggregating a large number each year, but no matter
what the number, they must be given proper attention.</p>

<p>Handling freight claims is not one of the usual duties of the
shipping clerk, nevertheless, it is a proper topic for discussion in connection
with the subject of shipping. The traffic manager, when one
is employed, handles the freight claims; otherwise the details are
handled by some other minor official&mdash;as the cashier or the purchasing
agent.</p>

<p>The adjustment of claims involves, usually, a large volume of
correspondence, and requires a man of tact. He must possess patience
and persistence to a marked degree. Diplomacy of a high order is
necessary in his correspondence, and promptness is an important
factor. Threats have little effect, other than to delay adjustment
of the claim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>Before a claim is presented, all information pertaining to the
case in possession of the claimant must be assembled, and all facts
should be incorporated in the papers filed. A bill should be made
against the railroad for the amount of the claim, and to this should
be attached the freight receipt or other voucher. These papers should
be accompanied by a letter giving a plain statement of the basis of
the claim; if for an overcharge, the number of the tariff and the
classification on which it is based should be cited. The claim papers
should be as complete as it is possible to make them, presenting all
facts having a possible bearing, otherwise they will be returned by
the claim agent of the railroad for further information. Some of
the questions asked by the claim agent may seem trivial to the claimant,
but the answers are necessary to him in completing the files of
his office. When claim papers are returned through the local freight
office, the information asked should be given and the papers returned
at once.</p>

<p>Claimants become very impatient over delays in the adjustment
of their claims, forgetting that where they handle perhaps a dozen
claims a year, the railroad claim agent must handle thousands, involving
amounts ranging from a few cents to many hundreds of
dollars. They also overlook the fact that a shipment has passed
over several roads, and that before the claim can be adjusted, it must
be ascertained on what road the damage was sustained. The different
roads involved must adjust the claim between themselves, before
they can tell where the money with which to pay it is coming from.
The papers must pass through the hands of agents at all junction
and transfer points, and the claim departments of all roads involved,
before the claimant can expect a reply.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is not good business to rely solely on the
railroad. Claim papers sometimes repose indefinitely in the desk
of some local freight agent, until brought to light by a persistent
follow-up; occasionally the papers are lost. A follow-up of freight
claims is, therefore, a necessity. The shipper who is most persistent
in following up his claims, is usually the beneficiary of the most
prompt service.</p>

<p>Railroads number all claims as received, and invariably refer
to them by number. It is an excellent plan, therefore, for the shipper
to adopt a numerical system for the purpose of identification. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
quite important that all correspondence relating to a claim be kept
together, and this is best done by using a folder for each claim. The
number of claims is so small that it is not necessary to use an entire
drawer for claims; they can be accommodated in the front of a drawer
used for regular correspondence.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-234.jpg" width="400" height="343"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 11. Folder for Freight Claims</p>
</div></div>

<p>The outside of the folder should provide for the name and
address of the consignor or consignee, as the case may be, name of
the railroad on which claim is made, the shipper's claim number,
and the railroad's claim number, as shown in Fig. 11. In this folder,
copies of the bill and of all letters to the railroad company should be
filed. The folders are filed numerically, in the order of the shipper's
claim numbers.</p>

<p>To follow up the claim, and to provide an index to the file of
claim folders, a card, similar in form to the one shown in Fig. 12,
should be used. This card provides for a complete history of the
claim. At the head of the card is shown the name of the consignor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
or the consignee, shipping point, shipper's and railroad's claim
numbers, dates of shipment, receipt, and filing of claim, the railroad
on which claim is made, and the name of the claim agent. This is
followed by a brief statement of the nature and amount of the claim.
The two bottom lines provide for a record of the payment or rejection
of the claim. All of the information most likely to be needed is
found by turning to this card, without the necessity of consulting the
correspondence in the claim files.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-235.jpg" width="400" height="264"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 12. Card for Follow-Up of Claims</p>
</div></div>

<p>The manner of filing the card depends somewhat on circumstances.
The usual plan is to file alphabetically, under the name of
the consignor, first grouping by railroads. If goods are received
and shipped over but one road, all of the cards would be filed in one
index. But if more than one road is used, an index card would be
used for each road, and the cards arranged alphabetically back of
the index cards of the roads involved. This arrangement brings the
cards of all claims against one road together, which is a logical plan,
since it is the railroad with whom the claimant is dealing.</p>

<p>Across the top of the card is a series of numbers, from <i>1</i> to <i>31</i>.
These represent the days of the month, and are used in connection
with the follow-up of the claim. Metal tabs are placed over the dates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
on which it is desired to have the claim brought to notice&mdash;that is,
if the claim is to be followed up on the 20th, a tab is placed over the
number <i>20</i>. On that day all cards with tabs over this number are
removed from the file, and, after the claims have received proper
attention, the tabs are moved forward to the next follow-up date,
and the cards returned to the file.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-236.jpg" width="400" height="258"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 13. Record of Correspondence on Back of Follow-Up Card</p>
</div></div>

<p>A record of all correspondence in connection with the claim is
made on the back of the card, which is ruled and printed for the
purpose, as shown in Fig. 13. This constitutes a tracer which shows,
without reference to the files, just what correspondence has been
required in the adjustment of the claim.</p>

<p>When the number of claims on file is large, there should be
another record which will show the amount of claims outstanding
against each railroad. Of course, the card file gives this information,
but some of the cards are very likely to be out of the file, so that the
amount obtained by a recap of the cards at any time may not represent
the correct total.</p>

<p>An account with each railroad can be kept on a card, as shown
in Fig. 14. This card should be filed with the claim cards, immediately
behind the guide card of the road. In effect, it is a ledger
account, representing a contingent asset.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>From an accounting standpoint, the proper method is to charge
all claims to a claim account, crediting whatever account may be
affected, at the same time charging the railroad on the card referred
to above. If an overcharge has been paid on a shipment received,
the entry would be:</p>

<table id="t06" summary="t06">

 <tr>
  <td class="tdc">Claim Account</td>
  <td class="tdc">$_____</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td class="tdci">In Freight</td>
  <td class="tdci">$_____</td>
 </tr>

</table>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-237.jpg" width="400" height="345"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 14. Claim Account Card</p>
</div></div>

<p>When a claim is disposed of&mdash;paid or rejected&mdash;claim account
receives credit, while the debit is to cash, or the account originally
affected. Using the above illustration, if the claim is paid in full
the entry is:</p>

<table id="t07" summary="t07">

 <tr>
  <td class="tdc2">Cash</td>
  <td class="tdc">$_____</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td class="tdci">Claim Account</td>
  <td class="tdci">$_____</td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p class="p1">If the claim is rejected:</p>

<table id="t08" summary="t08">

 <tr>
  <td class="tdc2">In Freight</td>
  <td class="tdc">$_____</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td class="tdci">Claim Account</td>
  <td class="tdci">$_____</td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>


<p>Thus the claim account is a controlling account, the balance representing
the total claims outstanding, and agreeing with the totals
of the claims against the different roads as shown by the cards.
Claim account represents a questionable asset, and should be so
treated in the balance sheet, a liberal discount being made in the
value represented by the account.</p>

<h3 class="p2">EXPRESS SHIPMENTS</h3>

<p>Many business houses are selling classes of goods which are
most successfully shipped by express. This is especially true of those
houses that transact the larger part of their business by mail. The
question of shipping by express is, in itself, quite simple, but there
are numerous details connected with the handling of such orders
which require close attention. While these details vary in different
businesses, as a typical illustration the business of selling books by
mail has been selected.</p>

<p>When an order is received, the first step is to check the source&mdash;whether
from circularizing, a re-order, or periodical advertising,
and if the latter, the name of the publication. This information
should be entered on the original order.</p>

<p>Cash and charge orders should then be separated, and on the
charge orders the next step is to investigate the credit and check the
address, especially when no advance payment is made. The address
is checked against any list that may have been used, or against city
directories, when such are available. If the list used has proved
reliable, it usually is safe to pass the order from one whose name
appears therein. Or the occupation given in the directory may
warrant the acceptance of the risk. If he is a customer, his manner
of paying in the past is the best guide.</p>

<p>Should all of these sources of information fail, and if the customer
gives no references, it is well to secure a report from some
commercial or collection agency. It may be necessary to follow up
the agency, but if a reliable agency, like Martindale, is unable to
obtain information, it is best to refuse the order except on a cash
basis.</p>

<p>The order having been accepted, it should be entered in an
order register, giving the name of the purchaser, the address in
detail, description of the article ordered, source of the order, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
the price. A sheet, as shown in Fig. 15, should be used for each
day's sales. The sheets should be in duplicate, as a copy is needed
by the statistical department, from which to tabulate the sales from
different sources.</p>

<p>The next step is to open an account on a ledger card, as shown
in Fig. 16. At the same time a collection card should be made.
Both of these cards should be filled in from the original order&mdash;not
from the register. If the number is large, the accounts should be
numbered, the number being entered on both the ledger and collection
cards. From the ledger cards, the numbers are entered on the
register. Two indexes are made&mdash;one alphabetical and one geographical&mdash;on
plain index cards, only the name and address, name
of publication ordered, and the account number being shown. One
of these cards is filed alphabetically and the other geographically,
while the ledger cards are filed numerically.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-240.jpg" width="400" height="348"
         alt=""

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>Each day, before the cards are filed, the amount of the new
accounts should be obtained on an adding machine, and checked
against the total of the order register sheet. This will guard against
errors in transcribing, for it is improbable that the same error will
be made in entering the order on the register and on the card.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-241.jpg" width="400" height="435"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 17. Shipping Order and Label Made at One Writing</p>
</div></div>

<p>The statistical department will obtain a record of total sales
from the duplicate register sheet, and, for this reason, the amount
should be checked against the original sheet. Since these sheets are
footed by different people, this comparison affords a reasonable proof
of accuracy, and also insures the use of the same totals by the statistical
and order departments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>The order is now properly recorded and is ready for shipping.
But before a shipping order can be made, it must be routed. This
is done by consulting a postal and express shipping guide, in which
will be found the name of every postoffice in the country, the names
of the express companies reaching that point, or, if not an express
office, the name of the nearest office. The name of the express company
is entered on the order, which is then turned over to the billing
clerk.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-242.jpg" width="400" height="346"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 18. Prepaid Shipping Sheet</p>
</div></div>

<p>The making of a shipping order, Fig. 17, is the next step. At
the head of, and attached to, the order is a label as shown in the
illustration. This shows the name and address, and the name of
the express company, which information is duplicated on the order
blank by means of carbon paper. The body of the order gives full
particulars of the articles to be shipped, names of the order clerk,
checker, and entry clerk, together with the date. All orders should
next be entered on the shipping sheets, which are supplied by the
express companies. A prepaid sheet is shown in Fig. 18. This
is made in duplicate, one copy, signed by a representative of the
express company, remaining with the shipper. The copy for the
express company serves as a voucher for the collection of the charges.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-244.jpg" width="400" height="272"

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>The express shipping sheet and the orders, with labels attached,
should be sent to the packing and shipping room, where the goods
are packed and shipped. The order should then be returned to the
office, and filed with the customer's orders in the correspondence
files. This should be a formal acknowledgment, giving full information
as to when and how shipped.</p>

<p>It will be seen from the above that orders of this class necessitate
a number of details, each of which forms an important link in the
complete chain.</p>

<h3 class="p2">RETAIL DELIVERY SYSTEM</h3>

<p>Not the least important problem in shipping is that of the retail
store. While this problem is of special importance in a large city,
it is one which must be met by the retailer in every community.
Under present conditions, the retailer is obliged to deliver a large
per cent of the goods that he sells, and the tendency is for this percentage
to increase rather than decrease.</p>

<p>The shipping or delivery department is the busiest in the entire
establishment; the details are so many that only with the most perfect
system can the work be handled. The delivery system of one
of the big stores is a revelation to most men; and when our purchase,
which is but one of thousands made in an hour, is delivered at our
door, five or ten miles away, two to five hours later, we marvel at the
perfect working of an apparently complex machine. And yet, when
we study it, we discover that the controlling factor of this vast system
is its simplicity. Less confusion is found, and fewer mistakes are
made, in the delivery department of the largest stores in the world
than by the delivery boy of your corner grocer; and simple system&mdash;method&mdash;at
every step from the sale to the final delivery is responsible.</p>

<p>While not really complicated, the system of a big store is built
to care for many more details than are met with in the smaller store.
Since a vast majority of retail establishments are in the latter class,
this discussion is confined to the needs of a store of average size.</p>

<p><i>Average size</i> is a relative term. A store of average size in one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
community would be considered as a big store in another. In a
large city, leading stores dealing in exclusive lines&mdash;such as clothing,
shoes, or cloaks and suits&mdash;answer the description, and it is the needs
of such a store that are discussed herein. A system adapted to the
needs of a store of this class, can easily be expanded for a department
store or modified for a smaller establishment.</p>

<p><b>Delivery Tag.</b> A delivery system starts, not in the shipping
room, but when the sale is made. The very first requisite is a correct
address, and the securing of the address rests with the sales person.
Unless every necessary precaution to insure accuracy at this point is
taken, the further provisions of the system are without avail.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-246.jpg" width="400" height="294"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 19. Label with Colored Border to Indicate Routing</p>
</div></div>

<p>The first step, then, is for the sales person to write the label or
tag that is to be attached to the package. It should not be left for
another to write the final delivery ticket; this should invariably be
done by the sales person, who then becomes responsible for the
address. In some small stores, the duplicate sales ticket is made to
do service as a delivery ticket, but it is much the safer plan to use a
separate tag or label for this purpose. The address on the duplicate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
sales ticket is quite likely to be illegible, and to provide for all details
needed for delivery necessitates a larger ticket than otherwise would
be used.</p>

<p>One of the most practical schemes ever devised is to indicate
the section of the city by the color, size, or shape of the delivery
ticket. The city is first divided into sections, the commonly known
sectional divisions being used&mdash;as <i>North</i> side, <i>South</i> side, etc. When
the sale is made, the customer is asked in what section of the city
he resides, and then an appropriate label is selected. All labels are
the same in form, but printed a special color for each section. The
label shown in Fig. 19 is distinguished by a solid border and bar of
color, printed on white paper, all type being printed in black.</p>

<p>Every necessary detail should be provided for on the label.
The one illustrated shows the date, the name and address, <i>near what
street</i>, the flat number, the name of the salesman, initials of the inspector,
and amount (if any) of the <span class="smcap">C. O. D</span>. The caption, near
what street, is of special importance in a large city for it assists greatly
in routing deliveries. An address may be given as 437 E. 72nd St.,
but if it is known that this is near Baker Ave., it is much more quickly
located by the driver.</p>

<p>This label is written by the sales person and sent with the goods
to the packers. Here, it is pasted on the package&mdash;unless it is a
<span class="smcap">C. O. D.</span> package, in which case it is first initialed by an inspector.
The same is true of charge sales.</p>

<p><b>Routing Deliveries.</b> The delivery system proper begins with
the routing of the deliveries, which is the first thing done after the
goods reach the shipping room. Bins should be provided for the
different sections of the city and if the business warrants, these sectional
bins should be subdivided, the subdivisions representing routes.
Separate bins should be provided for <span class="smcap">C. O. D.</span> deliveries, and it is
well to have a bin for special deliveries, such as those to suburban
points, which usually are forwarded by express.</p>

<p>When the packages reach the shipping room, they are sorted
into these bins. As an aid to sorting, the colored labels described
prove their value. Since the color represents the section,
packages can be sorted as rapidly as they can be handled. After
they are sorted according to sections, the packages are again sorted
into routes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>In certain lines, such as groceries, the average delivery is made
up of several packages, all of which are put into a basket. Here,
the bins must be differently arranged, being but divisions of the floor
space. But the scheme of using colored labels or shipping tags
could be used to advantage, especially in a downtown store delivering
to all parts of the city. For a grocery with a trade confined to its
immediate neighborhood, the sectional divisions are not needed, but
the goods should be sorted by routes.</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>The Delivery Sheet.</b> After routing, the next step is to record
the deliveries. In all modern stores, deliveries to each section of the
city are made at stated hours. As a rule, the deliveries are entered
on the sheets just prior to the hour for the delivery.</p>

<p>Fig. 20 shows the form of the regular delivery sheet, which is
used for cash and charge sales. This sheet shows the date, the
name and address, number of packages, and sale number. The
column at the extreme right is for the signature of the customer as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
receipt for the goods. Whether or not it is either necessary or wise
to attempt to secure the signature of the customer, is a disputed question,
and probably depends on the class of goods delivered and the
extent of the business. A jeweler who delivers a valuable piece of
jewelry would be justified in demanding a receipt, but this would be
unnecessary for a grocer. The shipping clerk in one department
store gives it as his opinion that the signature is not necessary, and,
for proof, points to a record of but two inexpensive packages lost in
a year.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 21. Delivery Boy's Call Tag</p>
</div></div>

<p>At the bottom of the delivery sheet, calls are listed. This refers
to calls by the driver, where no deliveries are to be made. In a clothing
or department store, it frequently is necessary to call for goods
that have been delivered on approval, or on which alterations are to
be made.</p>

<p>The delivery sheets are put up in book form in duplicate. The
original is perforated so that it can be detached, while the duplicate
remains in the book. A book is used for each wagon, and each
driver signs for his deliveries in the space provided for that purpose
at the head of the sheet. The driver then takes the delivery sheet,
placing it in a spring-back binder, and turns it in on his return. It
is well to keep these sheets on file in the shipping room for at least a
month&mdash;when it is safe to destroy them.</p>

<p>When a call is to be made, a special tag is given to the driver to be
attached to the package. This tag, which is shown in Fig. 21, gives
the address, and any special instructions that may be necessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>When the call is for a garment to be altered, the person taking
he call usually ascertains what is to be done, and writes the instructions
on the back of the tag. In case no instructions are given in
advance, they are usually given when the call is made&mdash;in which
case they are written on the tag by the driver. When the package
reaches the shipping room, reference to the tag shows what is
wanted, and the package can be forwarded, at once, to the proper
department. Carrying out the color scheme, the call tag should be
of a special color to distinguish it from the delivery tag.</p>

<p><b>C. O. D. Deliveries.</b> Of special importance are <span class="smcap">C. O. D.</span> deliveries.
There must be a positive record which will make it possible
to check every item at every stage, including all items collected.</p>


<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 22. Collect on Delivery Tag</p>
</div></div>

<p>The handling of a <span class="smcap">C. O. D.</span> item begins with the sale, when the
sales person, in addition to noting on the sales slip that the item is
<span class="smcap">C. O. D.</span>, makes out a tag, as shown in Fig. 22. This tag, which
should be of a special color, is made with a perforated stub, and on
the stub the information on the tag itself is duplicated. The sales
person fills in, on both the tag and the stub, the name and address
of the customer, the amount to be collected, his own initials, the
number of the department, and the date.</p>

<p>The goods and the duplicate sales ticket go to the packing room,
while the original sales ticket and the tag go to the office, where they
are taken charge of by the <span class="smcap">C. O. D.</span> clerk. This clerk registers the
sale on a <span class="smcap">C. O. D.</span> register, stamps the number on the tag and stub,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
and returns them to the packing room. The tag is then attached, and
the package sent to the shipping room, while the duplicate sales ticket
goes to the auditor's office.</p>

<p>In a store where the packages are wrapped in the department
making the sale, the routine is changed to the extent of sending the
package direct to the shipping room, with a plain address label.
The package is held in the shipping room until the tag, sent direct
from the office, is received.</p>


<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 23. Special C. O. D. Delivery Book</p>
</div></div>

<p>After they are sorted by routes in the shipping room, all <span class="smcap">C. O. D.</span>
items are entered in special delivery books, as in Fig. 23. This book
is made in the same style, as the regular delivery book, with perforated
sheets, but should be made of paper of a different color.
The form differs but slightly from that of the regular book, the only
difference being the addition of columns for the <span class="smcap">C. O. D.</span> number
and the amount to be collected.</p>

<p>When a driver makes a <span class="smcap">C. O. D.</span> delivery, he gives the customer
a receipt on the tag, Fig. 22, but retains the stub. On returning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
from a delivery, he turns in the stub with the money, and the payments
are checked on the duplicate of his delivery sheet. If a package
is not delivered, it must be turned in with the complete tag
attached. All returned <span class="smcap">C. O. D.</span> packages are checked on the delivery
sheets and entered on the sheets for the next delivery. This
system insures a positive check on the driver, for he must turn in
either the package, or the stub and the money.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The office record of <span class="smcap">C. O. D.</span> items is in the form of a register, as
shown in Fig. 24. This register is provided with the same columns
as the <span class="smcap">C. O. D.</span> delivery sheet, with columns added for the route
number and the driver's number, these columns being used only in
the shipping room. All items are registered in numerical order,
a new series of numbers, starting with <i>No. 1</i>, being used each month.
The book is made with duplicate sheets, the original perforated.
Once a day, or as fast as the pages are filled, the originals are sent
to the shipping room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>The original sales ticket is placed in an envelope, stamped with
the <span class="smcap">C. O. D.</span> number and filed numerically by the <span class="smcap">C. O. D.</span> clerk,
who also keeps the register. In the system described, the tag receipt
takes the place of the sales ticket; but in many stores it is considered
best to send the sales ticket with the package.</p>

</div></div>

<p>When the shipping clerk receives the record sheet from the
office, he checks the items against his delivery books and enters the
route number and driver's number. As described, each driver's
stubs and returned packages are first checked against his delivery
sheet; all stubs are then checked
against the record sheet, which
makes a double check in the shipping
room. If a package is refused
it is returned either to the
department or the general stockroom,
and a receipt obtained on
the back of the tag. The shipping
clerk then returns the record
sheet to the office, with the money
collected and the tags representing
refused packages.</p>

<p>Sales tickets and cash are
turned over to the cashier, while
tags and sales slips of refused packages are sent to the auditor. The
auditor can check both the cash collected on <span class="smcap">C. O. D.</span>'s and returns
against the duplicate sales tickets in his possession.</p>

<p><b>Undelivered Goods.</b> One of the annoyances met with in the
delivery department of a large store is the difficulty in making deliveries
because people are not at home. Unsuccessful calls are common,
and while it is quite the general custom to leave packages with
a neighbor, it is not always possible to do this, which means that the
package must be returned to the store. And it frequently happens
that this brings forth a vigorous complaint from the customer, who is
positive that the delivery could have been made.</p>

<p>One merchant has found a simple solution of this difficulty,
which could be adopted with profit by all merchants in large cities.
Drivers are supplied with slips printed as shown in Fig. 25. When
no one is found at home, one of these slips is filled out and left in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
mail box. It shows the date, time of day, name of driver, and name
of person with whom the package has been left. The use of this
slip eliminates complaints and proves a great convenience to the
customer.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 26. Post-Card Notice of Attempted Delivery</p>
</div></div>

<p>When undelivered packages are returned to the store, and
nothing is heard from the customer within 48 hours, a postal card
notice, Fig. 26, is mailed to the customer. Frequently, failure to
deliver is due to the wrong address, but even if the correct address
is not found in the directories, the postal authorities usually succeed
in locating the customer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Special Deliveries.</b> Every store, especially in large cities, finds
it necessary to make special deliveries. The customer from out of
town, or about to leave town, wants a package delivered before a
certain hour; the delivery may be to a depot, hotel, office, or even a
residence. These are the deliveries
which cannot wait for the
regular trip of the wagon, but
are sent by a boy. The important
thing, so far as the delivery
department is concerned, is to
get them out on time.</p>

<div class="floatright">

<p>Fig. 27 shows a tag for special
deliveries, used by a clothing
house. The tag shows the
name and address of the customer,
with full particulars of the
time and place of delivery. At
the end is a perforated stub on
which the delivery instructions
are repeated. When the tag is
attached to the package by the
sales person, the stub is torn off
and sent directly to the shipping
room. The shipping clerk is
then on the lookout for the package,
and is expected to follow up
the proper department, which in
this business usually is the tailor
shop.</p>

<p>Another form of special delivery tag used by a department store
is shown in Fig. 28. This tag gives more detailed information
about each step taken, showing the names of all persons handling
the package, and the time at which it is handled by each.</p>

<p>When the delivery system of a retail store is studied, it is found
to be made up of simple methods, which are assembled to make a
complete machine, A noticeable feature of the entire system is that
the apparently insignificant details&mdash;the little things&mdash;are its most
important parts; which is true of all systems.</p>

<h2 class="p2">CORRESPONDENCE AND FILING</h2>

<h3 class="p2">INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p>This book deals with a subject of growing importance in every
office&mdash;that of handling correspondence and filing all papers and
documents which form a part of the records of every business. While
making no attempt to teach letter writing, suggestions are made which,
it is hoped, will prove of assistance to those whose duty it is to handle
correspondence. Among those whom it is hoped a study of this
book will benefit, are the incoming-mail clerk, the correspondent,
the stenographer, the private secretary, the file clerk, and, in fact,
every person who has anything to do with handling and preserving
business or professional correspondence.</p>

<p>Present-day conditions tend to increase the volume of correspondence
in every office, and any improvement that will reduce labor or
contribute to more prompt service is welcomed. Every concern,
except possibly the small establishment doing a strictly neighborhood
business, uses the mails more and more in the transaction of
its business; we buy, sell, pay bills, collect money, make contracts,
and execute all sorts of transactions by mail&mdash;all of which necessitates
writing letters. Not only is it necessary to answer letters promptly,
but the increasing accumulation of correspondence must be preserved
and filed in a manner that will permit of easy reference; all of which
emphasizes the necessity of systematic methods in the conduct of this
very important department.</p>

<p>In the belief that more representative illustrations will result,
and that they can readily be adapted to the needs of a small establishment,
the suggestions herein are applied to a business in which
the correspondence is large in volume.</p>

<h3 class="p2">OPENING AND DISTRIBUTING MAIL</h3>

<p><b>Opening Mail.</b> Incoming mail should invariably be delivered
to one desk in charge of a clerk, usually known as the <i>incoming-mail
clerk</i>. When a business has reached a position where a large correspondence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
is handled, it is poor business policy for an executive
to assume the task of opening the mail. The natural conclusion,
when a house has a large correspondence, is that its business is correspondingly
large, and the executive who is fitted for his position
can devote his energies to larger tasks with better results. He should
be free to look after the big things&mdash;to plan greater results for his
business or his department.</p>

<p>The argument has been advanced that it might be dangerous
to trust a clerk with such business secrets as are found in the correspondence,
but in the handling of business transactions practically
every one of these "secrets" come to the knowledge of several clerks.
Surely, if employes can be trusted with the cash and to keep the
accounts&mdash;if stenographers can be trusted to take letters of the most
confidential nature&mdash;a clerk can be trusted to open and distribute
the mail.</p>

<p><b>Sorting Mail.</b> Sorting the mail is the first duty of the incoming-mail
clerk. This sorting is important in that all personal mail may
be taken out before it is opened. A general rule among all large
houses is to instruct all employes to have personal mail sent to their
private or home addresses, but in spite of all precautions an occasional
personal communication will come to the business address. An
acquaintance may know that Smith works for Jones &amp; Co. and,
having forgotten his personal address, sends his letter in care of
the house.</p>

<p>If Smith happens to be an unimportant employe, there will be
no question about the communication being personal; but if he is
a department head, there may be reasons for doubt. Large business
organizations are divided into departments, each in charge of a
manager. The correspondence of each department is signed by
the head, over his official title. A reply may be addressed in the
name of the house, to <i>Smith, Sales Manager</i>, or to <i>Smith</i>, without
the title. The letter addressed to <i>Smith, Sales Manager</i>, belongs
to the house, but if his title is omitted, it belongs to Smith, and to
open it without permission is a violation of the law. When the
departmental correspondence is heavy, a considerable number of
letters addressed to the manager, but without his title, may be received,
and it is the custom in many houses to secure written permission
from department heads to open all such letters. This protects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
the clerk in case a personal letter is opened by mistake, and
insures prompt attention to correspondence received during the
absence of the department manager.</p>

<p><b>Distributing Incoming Mail.</b> After the mail is opened, it should
be carefully distributed. While it is not necessary to read every
letter, the incoming-mail clerk should read as much of each letter
as may be necessary to determine to what department it should go.
Frequently, a letter addressed to one department refers to matters
requiring the attention of another&mdash;a letter ordering goods may be
addressed to the advertising manager, or a remittance to the sales
department; or a letter may require the attention of more than one
department.</p>

<p>In a large organization it is a very good plan to designate the
departments and executives by numbers, that is, the president might
be <i>No. 1</i>, the general manager, <i>No. 2</i>, the sales manager, <i>No. 3</i>,
etc. When a letter requires the attention of two or more departments,
these numbers should be placed on the letter in the order
of their importance. On a letter containing a remittance and asking
for a quotation, the sales manager's number would follow that
of the cashier. Such letters are sent to the department whose number
appears first, and the numbers indicate to the correspondent
that the letter is to be referred to another department.</p>

<p>For distributing the mail, the clerk should be supplied with
baskets labeled with the names or numbers of the departments.
Mail can then be distributed quickly to the proper departments.
If the number of baskets exceeds six, a rack should be provided for
them at the side of the desk.</p>

<p>In some offices, the incoming-mail clerk makes a record of all
orders received, before sending them to the sales or order department;
in most concerns, however, this is done in the statistical department,
after the orders have been passed upon. If the business
is strictly cash and not too large, the statistical work can be done
by the mail clerk.</p>

<p>Fig. 1 shows a tally sheet which is made up by the mail clerk
for a small mail-order house. The sales of this house are divided
by departments, each department representing a few specialties.
While the business is essentially mail-order, a few agents are employed.
On this sheet, columns are provided for a record of the
articles sold by each department, the number and amount of cash
and credit sales as a result of advertising, sales by salesmen divided
in the same manner, total cash and credit sales, and the grand total.
The cross-footings show the total sales of each article, while the
column footings show the total sales, divided between advertising
and salesmen, and whether cash or credit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>When the mail is sorted, all orders are placed together, and
these are then sorted into the classes shown by the tally sheet. To
prevent holding order, a memorandum tally should be made of each
lot of mail handled, and the totals for the day entered on the sheet.</p>

<p>The tally sheet should be loose-leaf and made in manifold.
A sufficient number of copies should be made to supply all department
heads who have a direct interest in the volume of the day's
business. Usually, copies will be required by the executives and the
sales manager.</p>

<p><b>Departmental Distribution.</b> The sorting and distribution of
the mail, after it reaches the department for which it is intended,
is also of considerable importance. And, in this sorting, the department
manager's stenographer can render valuable assistance. For
the same reason that the head of the house is relieved of details, the
head of a department should strive to rid himself of tasks which can
be as well performed by a subordinate.</p>

<p>Whether the mail is sorted by the correspondent or his stenographer,
it should be gone through before an attempt is made to answer
it. Letters that can be answered at once should be placed by themselves;
those necessitating further information should be handled
specially; if a letter requires the attention of another department,
it should be answered immediately and passed on.</p>

<p>Under this plan, the mail is prepared for answer before a stenographer
is called to take dictation, which saves time. The correspondent
who does not plan his work calls a stenographer and starts
dictating, taking the first letter that comes to hand. When a letter
about which further information is needed is found, he sends to
the files for correspondence, wasting both his own and his stenographer's
time while waiting for the information.</p>

<p>Before any letters are answered, the necessary notations should
be made on all letters requiring information, and the letters sent
to the proper departments. The very first letters answered should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
be those that must be referred to another department. These
should be not only dictated first, but transcribed and forwarded to
the next department before further dictation is given.</p>

<p>These methods will go far toward solving the problem of the
prompt handling of correspondence. Most large houses receive
complaints of delay in answering letters, and when these complaints
are investigated the causes of delay are found to be divided between
a lack of method in handling correspondence and ignorance or carelessness
on the part of the complainant. In any well-managed
concern everything possible will be done to overcome the first-named
defect, even to the extent of providing a system which will, at least
partially, overcome the defects due to the latter cause.</p>

<p>As to the complaints due to ignorance or carelessness, it is found
that at least 75% of all complaints received come within this classification.
In many cases complaints come from persons whose correspondence
is limited to a half-dozen letters, or less, a day. They
fail to appreciate the difficulties of the correspondent whose dictation
averages a hundred letters a day; being unaccustomed to the
departmental plan of organization, they do not realize that each subject
about which they write must be referred to one certain department.
And so, a single letter contains an order, a remittance, and
a request for some special information, and, because he does not receive
a reply covering all subjects referred to in his letter by return
mail, the customer complains of delay. It is entirely legitimate to
politely request a customer to use a separate sheet for each subject&mdash;as
orders, remittances, complaints, etc.&mdash;but since not all will comply,
some such method as has been described is needed to insure against
unreasonable delay in handling letters that require the attention of
several departments.</p>

<p>In another class is the letter which, for some reason, cannot
be answered at once. An example is the letter to a manufacturer,
asking for a price on a special machine. Before a price can be named,
the engineering department must make a careful estimate of the
cost, and it may be necessary to secure quotations on some special
material needed. This means an unavoidable delay, but the prospective
customer should not be left in a state of expectancy&mdash;the
letter should be acknowledged immediately, and the cause of the
delay explained. The customer then feels that he is receiving attention,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
while if no reply is made until full information can be given,
a competitor more courteous may secure the order.</p>

<p><b>Interdepartment Correspondence.</b> Of considerable importance
in every large organization is the interdepartment correspondence&mdash;the
notes from one department head to another. Every department
head finds it necessary at times to request information from other
departments. Even with an intercommunicating telephone system,
with which every large office and plant should be equipped, many
of these requests are of a nature that, to guard against misunderstandings,
demand written communications.</p>

<p>Usually, these communications call for prompt replies; a letter
from a customer may be held or some important action delayed
until the information is received. A good rule for the correspondent
is to give attention to these notes as soon as received, and answer
them at the earliest possible moment. The stenographer should,
as a rule, write these notes first, or if written in the order in which
they are dictated, should place them on the correspondent's desk
immediately. Of course, judgment must be exercised, for some of
these notes do not require immediate attention and should be held
until more important correspondence is disposed of.</p>

<p>There are also many notes giving instructions, either from a
department head to his subordinates, or from the executive heads
to the heads of departments. Except on general orders, affecting
all employes, the names of all department heads to whom the order
applies, should appear at the head of such notes. The manager
may wish to call attention to some act, common to all department
heads, without making it a personal matter with any one of them,
so writes the same note to all. For example:</p>

<p class="pnri">July 15, 1909.</p>

<p class="pnred">Mr. Blake,<br />
Mr. Watson,<br />
Mr. Kimball,<br />
Mr. Cobb,<br />
Mr. Royce,</p>

<p class="reduct">Gentlemen;</p>

<p class="pnrt">During the past few days some of you have been a little careless
about getting to the office on time. If you arrive 5 or 10 minutes late, it will
have a very unfortunate effect on the discipline of your department, and I
trust that each of you will strive to overcome the habit of arriving late&mdash;a
habit which, I am sure, is entirely due to carelessness on your part.</p>

<p class="pnri2">Yours truly,</p>
<p class="pnri">General Manager.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">In the above example, five copies of the note are required, and
four of these can be carbon copies. When Mr. Blake or Mr. Watson
receives the note, he knows that it is not addressed to him alone, but
that each of the others has received a copy. Without detracting from,
but rather adding to, its effectiveness, this note leaves a much more
pleasant impression than a personal note to each man. No one
man feels that he has been singled out for criticism.</p>

<h3 class="p2">CORRESPONDENCE SHORT CUTS</h3>

<p><b>Dictating by Number.</b> One of the greatest time savers in handling
correspondence is dictation by numbers. The plan is to
indicate each letter by a number, instead, of requiring the stenographer
to take down the name and address.</p>

<p>Probably 90 per cent of the letters dictated are replies to other
letters. When the correspondent has his mail ready for dictation,
he should write, or stamp with a numbering stamp, <i>No. 1</i> on the first
letter answered. To the stenographer he will say "<i>No. 1</i>," and,
instead of the name and address, this number is entered in the stenographer's
notebook. The original letter, from which the address is
obtained, is turned over to the stenographer. A new series of numbers,
beginning with <i>No. 1</i>, should be used each day, to run consecutively
during the day.</p>

<p>Careful tests, made in different offices, show that in taking
ordinary business correspondence dictation, the stenographer wastes
about 20 per cent of the time writing the name and address. By
the use of the numbering plan, practically all of this time is saved.</p>

<p><b>Form Paragraphs.</b> A large per cent of the correspondence of
the average business is a repetition of the things that have been said
before. Day after day the same questions are asked and answered,
the same complaints are received, the same arguments, formal acknowledgments,
and requests form a large part of the dictation.
Over and over the same paragraphs are used to say the same things,
a repetition and waste of time for both correspondent and stenographer,
which can be done away with by the use of form paragraphs.</p>

<p>For illustration, the acknowledgment of remittances is entirely
formal, rarely necessitating a special letter. Many times, however,
the letter of remittance asks for special information, which can be
given in the same letter with the acknowledgment. If one or more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
form acknowledgment paragraphs are prepared to meet different
conditions, one of these can be used, saving the time required for
dictation.</p>

<p>Form paragraphs are especially applicable in answering complaints
and in sales letters. Complaints can usually be divided into
a few classes, and one paragraph will answer all complaints of the
same kind. In sales letters, form paragraphs will answer all requests
for certain information about the product, the terms of sale, the
guaranty, etc.</p>

<p>Not only do form paragraphs save much time in dictation, but
they result in stronger letters. It is the experience of every correspondent
that he can write better letters one day than another.
The best form paragraphs are found in the letters written on the correspondent's
good days.</p>

<p>Form paragraphs should be arranged for ready reference. A
very satisfactory method is to write them on sheets punched for
filing in a binder. The paragraphs should be numbered consecutively,
and indexed by subject. Copies should be supplied to all correspondents
and stenographers who have occasion to use them.</p>

<p>Frequently a large part of the day's correspondence can be
handled with form paragraphs, and through constant use the stenographer
will become so familiar with them that he will be in a position
to answer many letters without dictation. The really efficient stenographer&mdash;one
of the kind who expects to advance to the position of
private secretary&mdash;will make a careful study of form paragraphs,
fitting himself to handle the minor correspondence, thereby saving the
more valuable time of the correspondent.</p>

<p><b>Talking Machines for Dictation.</b> Every year sees an increase
in the use of the talking machine for dictation. These machines
have now been brought to a state of perfection which makes their
use feasible, and in many large offices they are used to the almost
complete exclusion of shorthand writers.</p>

<p>An outfit for correspondence work consists, usually, of two
machines&mdash;one for recording and one for reproducing dictation.
The correspondent dictates his letters to the recording machine
and passes the cylinders on which the record has been made to the
stenographer, who transcribes on the typewriter direct from the
reproducing machine. In small offices, one machine is made to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
answer every purpose, as it can be changed instantly from a recorder
to a producer.</p>

<p>After the dictation on a cylinder has been transcribed it is shaved,
and is then ready for a new record. This permits of the use of the
cylinders until they are worn thin, and reduces the expense to a
minimum.</p>

<div class="floatleft">

         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 2. The Dictaphone<br /><i>Columbia Phonograph Co.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>The principal advantages claimed for this machine are that
it saves all of the time of the stenographer usually required for taking
dictation; the correspondent can dictate at any time without waiting
for a stenographer; the work is more evenly distributed, and consequently
finished earlier in the day. In
the opinion of the writer, the chief advantage
lies in having the machine at
hand ready for dictation day or night.</p>

<p>While in some offices the shorthand
writer has been almost entirely supplanted,
the machine is more likely to
be used as an auxiliary. It can never
supply the brains of the human machine,
and is not likely to lessen the demand
for competent stenographers. Fig. 2 is
an illustration of one of the well-known
makes of correspondence machines.</p>

<p><b>Correspondence Requisitions.</b> A considerable
per cent of the letters to be answered
in a business office are of such a nature that former correspondence
must be referred to before an intelligent reply can be given.
The unsatisfactory character of the replies to many letters can be
traced to the fact that the correspondent did not take the trouble
to first find out what had been written before.</p>

<p>To insure against the loss of correspondence, it should be most
carefully filed, and every letter should be accounted for. Also, if a
correspondent wants certain correspondence from the files he should
state explicitly what correspondence or information he desires.
This not only insures his getting the information needed to formulate
an intelligent reply, but protects the file clerk.</p>

<p>The systematic method is to have a correspondence requisition,
similar to the one shown in Fig. 3. On this requisition is noted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
just what is wanted&mdash;invoice, order, or letter&mdash;with room for special
instructions. One of these requisitions should be sent to the files
whenever any papers are wanted, and nothing should be delivered
without such a requisition. By placing this requisition in the files,
in place of the papers removed, the file clerk can always trace missing
correspondence.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-269.jpg" width="400" height="249"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 3. Requisition for Correspondence</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>Complaints and Changes of Address.</b> In some lines of business,
complaints and notices of change of addresses are quite numerous.
An example is the business of publishing a weekly or monthly periodical.
Many complaints are received from subscribers who claim
that they do not receive the publication regularly. The great majority
of these complaints can be traced to carelessness on the part of the
subscriber in failing to notify of change of address.</p>

<p>In some businesses, the handling of complaints requires the
services of a correspondent, and a clerk to trace the complaint and
gather the information necessary before an adjustment can be made.
In a smaller business, the work of looking up the information usually
falls on the stenographer. But no matter who gathers the information,
the correspondent never should attempt to answer or adjust a
complaint until he has made a thorough investigation. Not until
he understands all of the causes leading up to the complaint, can he
correctly judge of its merits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>The policy of having all complaints handled by one man is in
keeping with approved business practice. A man who makes a
study of the subject soon learns to handle complaints to the ultimate
satisfaction of all concerned. Being independent of the selfish
interests of a particular department, he is much more likely to serve
the best interests of the house than any other man in the organization.
The sales manager, for instance, is not the best man to adjust complaints
of customers; he is likely to be more liberal than is warranted,
because of his fear of losing trade.</p>

<p>When a complaint has been investigated, everything possible
should be done to remove the cause, and to guard against a similar
complaint in the future. The seemingly little precautions count
for much. In the matter of changes of address, for instance, it is a
small matter for the one who makes the change to see that it is made
not only on the ledger but on the sales list, the collection card, and
in every place where the address is permanently recorded. Failure
to make the change in one place may lead to endless confusion.</p>

<p><i>Stenographer's Reference Index.</i> Here is a suggestion for the
special benefit of the stenographer. Keep in your desk a reference
index of names, addresses, and telephone numbers. There are certain
persons and firms to whom your employer frequently writes
letters. These are not in reply to letters, but are written in the usual
course of business. The names of these persons should be on your
index so that when you are told to write to Mr. Hunter or Mr. Roberts
you will not be obliged to ask the address.</p>

<p>Probably your employer will not ask you to keep such an index,
but surely will appreciate your knowing the addresses. When he
finds that you always know the telephone numbers of the printer,
the bank, and other local houses with whom he does business regularly,
as well as the addresses of prominent out-of-town correspondents,
he will at least not place it to your discredit.</p>

<p>But do not keep the addresses on sheets of paper that surely
will soon become confusing on account of changes and additions
which make an alphabetical arrangement impossible. Ask for a
small card tray, holding 3"×5" cards, that will go in the drawer of
your desk, a set of alphabetical indexes, and a supply of blank cards.
Such an outfit can be bought at any first-class stationer's for a dollar
or two. When you want to preserve an address, write it on a card,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
and file it alphabetically. If your employer will not supply the outfit,
cut slips of paper and indexes to fit one of the small compartments
in the desk drawer. Have the index, even if you must devise your
own method of keeping it; you will at least have the satisfaction of
saving many minutes of your time. And in the formation of a
systematic habit you will be adding to your equipment.</p>

<p><b>Making Corrections.</b> All stenographers make mistakes, and
no correspondent is entirely free from faulty dictation, which necessitates
corrections in letters after they are written. But the time of
the stenographer and, incidentally, expense to the house, can be saved
if the correspondent will exercise reasonable care in indicating the
corrections to be made.</p>

<p>Do not deface the letter so that neat corrections will be impossible,
unless the mistake is so serious as to necessitate rewriting the
entire letter. When the wrong word has been used, draw a light
pencil line under it and write the correct word on the margin or the
end of the letter; if the word is misspelled, underline it and write the
correct spelling at the end of the line. This takes even less time than
to deface the letter, and leaves it in such shape that corrections can
be made quickly and neatly.</p>

<p>To the stenographer it is well to say, "If you find it impossible to
make a neat correction, rewrite the letter." Nothing gives a more
unfavorable impression of a house than an untidy letter, and your
employer is more willing to overlook an occasional mistake than a
letter filled with visible erasures.</p>

<h3 class="p2">COPYING CORRESPONDENCE</h3>

<p>Copies of outgoing correspondence are a part of the system of
every business office. There was a time when copies of important
letters were made by hand, and then came the copying press and
tissue impression book with many cloths, wringers, pans of water,
and other paraphernalia for moistening the sheets of the book. The
copying press is an awkward machine, difficult to operate, and
altogether unsatisfactory, but, until a better method was offered,
it answered the purpose.</p>

<p>One of the greatest defects in the copying-book method is the
impossibility of making uniformly clear copies; some will be clear
while others are blurred, and the important letter is usually the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
that is illegible. The difficulty in securing clear copies is due to the
impossibility of securing uniform pressure. While the copying press
is still found in a few small offices, it is practically obsolete, and not
used in offices where modern efficient methods receive consideration.</p>

<p><b>Carbon Copies.</b> A simple method of obtaining copies of outgoing
letters, invoices, orders, etc., is to make duplicates by means
of carbon paper. In its adaptability and far-reaching effect, the
sheet of carbon paper has proved to be one of the greatest of all aids
to modern business methods. Used in connection with a typewriter
of modern construction, the carbon sheet has revolutionized manifolding
processes, making possible as many duplicate copies of any
paper as are required in ordinary business.</p>

<p>The carbon method of obtaining copies of letters has the merit
of economy in time. When the letter is written, the copy is made;
if extra copies, up to a half-dozen, are wanted, all are made at one
writing. If the last letter is being written when it is time for the mail
to leave the office, it need not be held to make a copy.</p>

<p>The carbon method is not expensive. Good carbon paper costs
2 cents or less a sheet, and for 1,000 copies only about 30 sheets are
required. A satisfactory quality of plain paper for copies can be
bought for $1.00 or less a thousand. These prices are naturally
subject to slight fluctuations, depending on the quantities purchased
and the locality.</p>

<p>A defect in the carbon method is found in the manner of making
corrections. It is not uncommon for a man to make a slight correction,
or add a note, in his own handwriting; such corrections and
additions cannot appear on the carbon copy. When corrections are
made on the typewriter, it is very difficult to obtain a clear copy of
the correction on the second, or carbon, sheet&mdash;the correction on the
copy is very likely to be blurred. If the correction is written directly
on the copy, without using carbon paper, the essential feature of the
copy is destroyed; it is no longer a facsimile, and its value as evidence
is very materially lessened.</p>

<p><b>Mechanical Copiers.</b> There are now on the market several
mechanical copiers, without the many disadvantages of the copying
press, or the defects of the carbon method. One of the most satisfactory
and best known is the roller copier. The fundamental
principle of the roller copier is that of the clothes wringer; the original<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
letter, with a wet tissue sheet placed against the written side, is passed
between rubber rollers, to which just the right amount of pressure is
applied.</p>

<p>Working from the clothes-wringer idea as a basis, the inventor
of the roller copier set about to remedy the defects of the copying
press. It was found that clear copies could be obtained only under
certain conditions; the pressure must be absolutely uniform, and the
tissue sheet must be moistened evenly.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-273.jpg" width="400" height="292"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 4. Mechanism of the Yawman &amp; Erbe Roller Copier</p>
</div></div>

<p>As to the pressure, it was found that too much or too little resulted
in unsatisfactory copies&mdash;some faint, others blurred&mdash;the
very defect that had made the use of the copying press objectionable.
This was overcome by using an adjusting screw by which the exact
pressure required could be obtained. But, if the pressure were left
on all of the time, the rubber rollers would soon be flat. So, an adjustment
lever was added, by which the pressure could be thrown
on before copying, and thrown off when the machine is not in use.</p>

<p>To adjust a single sheet of tissue paper so that it would lie
smooth on the letter, was out of the question. This difficulty was
overcome by copying on a continuous roll, and the problem of moistening
was solved by passing the paper through water, insuring equal
moisture over the entire surface.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>The mechanism of the roller copier is shown in Fig. 4. The
paper from the roll is passed under the dampening roll in the water
tank, then between the large roller and the wringing roller, over the
same large roller and between it and the copying roller, thence out
over the flanged roller and down to the winding reel. The pressure
on the wringing and copying roller is adjusted by the adjusting
screws <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, and the adjustment
lever throws the
pressure on or off. The letter
to be copied is laid face down
on the feeding shelf, the edge
is placed under the copying
roller, pressure thrown on, and a turn
of the crank carries the letter through
into a receiving basket, leaving a perfect
copy. If additional copies are
wanted&mdash;any number up to a half-dozen&mdash;the
operation is repeated for
each copy.</p>

<div class="floatleft">
     <img src="images/ill-274.jpg" width="200" height="225"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 5. General View<br />of the
Yawman &amp; Erbe<br />Roller Copier</p>
</div></div>

<p>The paper on which the copies
have been made passes to a winding
reel under the copier, as shown in
Fig. 5. This is a large rectangular
reel on which the paper is stretched tightly, so that it will be
smooth when dry. The open construction of the reel affords free
circulation of air, drying the copies very quickly. After the
day's copying is done, the action of the machine is reversed by the
turn of a thumbscrew, the paper is broken above the last copy, that
on the reel is brought back over the copier, and the letters cut apart
with the cutting knife at the end of the feeding shelf. The separate
copies are then ready for filing with the original letters, keeping
letters and replies together.</p>

<p>Among the advantages claimed for the machine are certainty of
legible copies, copies of all corrections, and economy of operation. The
copies are made after the letter has been written and corrected;
consequently it must be a facsimile. If a note is written at the
bottom or on the margin, it is shown in the copy.</p>

<p>Copying is the last operation before mailing. Frequently a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
man finds, after the letter is written, that he needs additional copies.
With the carbon system it is necessary to rewrite the letter; with the
copier, the copies can be obtained any time before the letter is mailed.</p>

<p>The copier is economical in operation. The best quality of
paper costs 50 cents a roll, and a little more than one roll, or about
60 cents' worth of paper is required for 1,000 copies; and there is no
carbon paper to buy. The office boy can operate the copier, and it
takes but a few minutes to copy the day's mail of the average concern.
If desired, the machine can be obtained with an electric motor
attached, but this power is really unnecessary unless the correspondence
averages 300 or more letters a day.</p>

<h3 class="p2">STENOGRAPHIC DIVISION</h3>

<p>As has been stated elsewhere in this series of books, the modern
plan for a large organization is to have an independent stenographic
division or department. Instead of each department head and correspondent
having one or more stenographers in his office, to handle
his work only, this plan contemplates placing all stenographers and
typists in one room, in charge of a chief stenographer. Except where
an executive officer has a stenographer who acts as his private secretary,
this plan is now carried out in the most highly organized of our
larger enterprises.</p>

<p>The stenographers are subject to the call of any correspondent,
the chief stenographer supplying the one who is first available. The
plan is sometimes modified to the extent of holding a stenographer for
the work of a certain correspondent during stated hours; the stenographer
being, at other times, available for any other correspondent.</p>

<p>The plan has proved to be economical and beneficial in many
other ways. It is economical, as it reduces the number of stenographers
actually needed to handle the work. Under the old plan,
some of the stenographers are idle a part of the time, or obliged to
do copy work to keep busy. For example, in a certain house, two
departments were located in adjoining rooms. The department
heads each had more work than one stenographer could do, but not
sufficient to keep two busy all the time; it was necessary for each
to employ two stenographers&mdash;four in all&mdash;and let them fill in a
part of their time addressing envelopes, and similar work. The
plan of having a common stenographic force was tried, and three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
stenographers handled the work of both departments, with some
time to spare for the work of other departments&mdash;a clear saving of
25%.</p>

<p>The stenographer is benefited by becoming familiar with the
correspondence of all departments. While not learning all of the
secrets of one department, the stenographer obtains a much better
insight into the business as a whole&mdash;far more valuable as a business
training than a more intimate knowledge of a single department.</p>

<p>Every correspondent is benefited by having several stenographers
who are familiar with his work. If a certain stenographer
leaves, is ill, or takes a vacation, he is not placed under the handicap
of having his work stand still until he can break in a substitute.
The new stenographer can be given some dictation in each department
while becoming familiar with the work.</p>

<p>The work is more evenly distributed, with the result that the
mail is out on time and no stenographer is obliged to work after
hours. When all work together under one chief, the efficiency of
the stenographic force, individually and collectively, is materially
increased.</p>

<p>Not the least of the many advantages of this plan is the one of
having all typewriters in one place, confining the noise. Employes
in other departments of the office are greatly benefited by working
in comparative quiet. Especially advantageous is the absence of
the noise of the typewriter in private offices.</p>

<p>When the stenographic division is installed, it is necessary to
provide a system of call bells, with a push button at the desk of each
correspondent. Each correspondent is assigned a signal by which
he may summon a stenographer. The chief assigns a stenographer
to answer each call, or in the absence of the chief, the one whose
turn it is answers the call.</p>

<p><b>Records of Work.</b> An independent stenographic division
necessitates a careful record of work performed. These records
are required in order that the expense may be distributed and the
wages of the stenographers charged to the proper departments.
A distribution of office expense is just as necessary as a distribution
of factory charges. The records should show exactly what it costs
to conduct the purchasing, sales, or credit departments. If a man
divides his time between two or more departments, his salary should
be charged accordingly. In like manner, the wages of a stenographer
should be distributed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 6. Stenographer's Weekly Record of Work, Distributed by Departments</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>Elaborate or complicated records are not required; a record
of the time worked for each department is sufficient, though usually
the number of letters written is included. First, is the record of work
done by each individual. This should be a record covering a week's
work, and may be kept on a card. Fig. 6 shows a form designed
for such a record. This is on a 5"×8" card, one of which is given
to each stenographer, who keeps the record from day to day.</p>

<p>This form provides for a record of the work of the stenographer
each day in the week. The columns from left to right are headed
with the names of the departments, but instead of having these
printed in, it is best to leave the spaces blank and write the names.
The daily record shows the hours worked and number of letters
written, both morning and afternoon, for each department. Space
is also provided for a record of miscellaneous or special work, which
should be explained briefly. The total number of hours shown by
this record should, of course, agree with the time for which the
stenographer is paid.</p>

<p>These cards should be turned in to the chief stenographer,
who will file them under the name or the number of the stenographer,
keeping all records of each employe together. If preferred, daily
reports can be used, though the weekly report will prove satisfactory
in almost every case.</p>

<p>On receipt of the individual reports, the chief stenographer
should make up a weekly report of the work of the entire division.
The object of the report is primarily to show the amount to be charged
to each department for stenographic work, but may also show the
cost of each stenographer.</p>

<p>The form shown in Fig. 7 provides for a complete report. The
work of each stenographer for each day of the week is distributed
among the several departments, showing the number of hours worked,
the number of letters written, and the cost. A record for five departments
with six stenographers is provided for in the form shown.
The footings of the columns show the total cost to the departments
and the total column at the right, which is an extension of daily costs,
shows the total cost for each stenographer. The footing of the total
column, and the cross-footing of the departmental columns, must
agree and exactly equal the amount of the pay-roll of the stenographic
division.</p>

<p>One valuable comparison shown by this report is the cost to
handle the work of one department or correspondent, when different
stenographers are used. The comparison must be based on the
letters of one correspondent, because, while they are not likely to
vary materially, there is a marked difference in the length of the
letters written by different correspondents; also, the dictation of
some correspondents is much more easy to take than others.</p>

<p>The form shown should be loose-leaf, and made in duplicate.
One copy goes to the comptroller and one is kept by the chief stenographer.
The size can be increased to accommodate a large number
of departments or stenographers, but rather than use a sheet that is
bulky, it is better to use more than one sheet. To provide for a
monthly distribution of costs, these reports should be closed on the
last day of the month, regardless of the day of the week.</p>

<p><b>Hints for Stenographers. Telegrams.</b> When a telegram is sent,
it is safe to assume that its object is to secure quick action; otherwise
a letter would serve the purpose. Telegrams should, therefore,
be transcribed and dispatched immediately, regardless of any other
work that may be on the machine.</p>

<p>It has become the usual custom of business to confirm telegrams
by mail. The more usual custom is to write a letter, in which the
telegram is quoted, but the matter can be handled with less labor
by the use of triplicate telegraph blanks. The original is the regulation
blank supplied by the telegraph companies; the duplicate is on
a sheet of the same size as the telegraph blank, but printed as shown
in Fig. 8; the triplicate is a blank sheet of paper. The duplicate is
mailed to the correspondent, while the triplicate is filed with his
correspondence. Unless some special explanation is demanded, it
is unnecessary to write a letter.</p>

<p><b>Don'ts.</b> Don't keep your employer waiting while you hunt for,
or sharpen, a pencil. Always keep a supply of at least a half-dozen
well-sharpened pencils on hand. Keep them in a handy place and
take them with you when your employer calls you to his desk to take
dictation. Remember that his time is more valuable than your own.</p>

<p>Don't be afraid of working a few minutes overtime, when requested
to do so. Only an unreasonable employer will ask you to work after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
hours, excepting when it is really necessary. But occasionally something
will come up at the last moment, making it necessary to write
and mail a letter that night. Remember that what seems to you a
trivial matter, may be of the utmost importance to your employer.</p>

<p>Don't overlook the important letters. If you handle a heavy
correspondence there will be many days when you will find it impossible
to transcribe all of the dictation you have taken, but some
of the letters will be important while others can be held over without
loss. Write the important letters first; if you are not sure which
they are, ask your employer. He will appreciate your interest.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 8. Confirmation of Telegram</p>
</div></div>

<p>Don't overlook the necessity of learning something about the
business in which you are employed. Every business has its own
nomenclature&mdash;technical terms peculiar to the business, with which
you may be unfamiliar. When you accept a new position, read the
catalogs, circulars, and other literature of the house; this is the easiest
way to familiarize yourself with the technical terms. You will find
your position improved if you can correctly transcribe the terms
peculiar to the business.</p>

<p>Don't waste envelopes and postage. Your employer may write
a half-dozen letters to one firm the same day. This frequently
happens in writing to branch offices and agencies. See to it that all
letters to the same address are enclosed in one envelope. The
saving in postage will be very considerable.</p>

<p>Don't underestimate the opportunities afforded by your position.
There really is no position offering better chances for advancement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
than that of the willing and competent stenographer. There
are many incompetents, and for such salaries are small; but there
are plenty of positions at good salaries open to the really competent.
A stenographer handles many confidential matters, learns the business
secrets of his employer, and has every opportunity to learn the
business. The stenographer who takes advantage of the opportunities
to learn becomes a private secretary, and rapidly advances
to even more important positions.</p>

<p>Don't betray secrets. This is the most important <i>don't</i> of all.
Remember that your employer dictates many confidential letters,
imparting business and private secrets. Do not, under any circumstances,
impart these confidential matters to others, and never
talk about the business to those outside the office.</p>

<h3 class="p2">FILING DIVISION</h3>

<p>Only a small per cent of the records of a business are found in
the books of account; the larger part are in the form of business
papers of various kinds. And, since the records in the books are,
in the main, based on the records found in these papers, the papers
themselves are not less valuable than the books. Letters, orders,
invoices, receipts, vouchers, contracts, specifications, and estimates
form the basis of the larger part of the business transactions of all
houses, giving authority for transactions and offering proof that the
transactions have been completed. The proper preservation of
these papers is, therefore, a necessity, and, since they form so important
a part of the records, they must be accessible.</p>

<p>The filing division is, therefore, one of the most necessary in
the office of any enterprise, and should receive the careful attention
that its importance deserves. Whether the equipment of the filing
division consists of a single file or many large cabinets, it should be
located where it will be accessible to all departments. It should be
given as nearly a central location as the general plan of the office
will permit. In a very large enterprise a separate room may be required,
while in a small business the files may be arranged along the
wall or around a corner. But whatever its location, aisles leading to
the filing division should be left open, that it may be reached conveniently
from any part of the office. Since good light is not so
essential as for some other divisions, it is sometimes advisable to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
locate the filing division where the light is not sufficient for another
division&mdash;as the bookkeeping division. At the same time, there
must be sufficient light to enable the file clerk to do the work properly.</p>

<p>As a general rule, all filing should be in one place, although under
certain conditions, which are referred to later, special departmental
filing is justified. It should be possible to obtain from the general
files all papers that have a bearing on a particular transaction, or
all of the correspondence of a given concern. More or less confusion
results when certain of the papers are missing. For example, if a
part of the correspondence about an order is filed in the sales department,
the papers in the general file may not give a complete history
of the case, and the order may be accepted or rejected under a wrong
impression because the most important letter is missing.</p>

<p>When independent filing systems are maintained by the different
departments, it is sometimes difficult to determine just where certain
papers will be found. To say the least, it is quite difficult to collect
all of the papers referring to one subject, when the filing is handled
in this manner.</p>

<p>Experience has demonstrated that a central filing division is
really more convenient for the department manager, than to maintain
his own filing system. If the system has been properly installed,
he can obtain correspondence or other papers from the general files
about as quickly as from his own files, with the added advantage of
obtaining all of the correspondence with a particular person. If
another department has been in correspondence with the same
person, he has their letters as well as his own. When the credit
man, for example, reviews the correspondence of a customer from
whom he is trying to collect an account, he will not be ignorant of
the existence of a letter from the sales manager in which special
terms were offered to secure the order.</p>

<p><b>The File Clerk.</b> The filing division should be in charge of a file
clerk and the clerk should have full control of the work of the division.
In a large business, a chief file clerk and several assistants will be
required, while in a small business it is customary for the stenographer
to do the filing. No matter what the extent of the filing, the principle
is the same; if but two persons are employed and one is expected to do
the filing, the other should neither file nor remove papers from the file.
When a letter is wanted, the file clerk should be asked for it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>The essential qualifications of a file clerk may be summed up as
follows:</p>

<p class="p10 p1 b1">A good memory;<br />
The habit of accuracy;<br />
The ability to read confusing chirography;<br />
The ability to spell correctly;<br />
Speed.</p>

<p>To these might be added the possession of a liberal amount of
common sense, the faculty of absorbing information, and ability to
correlate facts according to their importance.</p>

<p>A good memory is very necessary, for the papers that have
been filed must be found when wanted. Letters signed by an individual
may be filed with the correspondence of his firm. When
the manager calls for "that letter from Whitcomb," it is embarrassing
to ask him with what firm Mr. Whitcomb is connected; still more
so to keep the manager waiting while an index is consulted.</p>

<p>A comprehensive index is necessary, of course, and the efficient
file clerk will be fortified against all possible contingencies with proper
indexes, but a memory which will permit of ignoring indexes, except
in special cases, is a valuable asset. It may be stated as a rule that
it should not be necessary to refer to special indexes to locate the
letters of a regular correspondent.</p>

<p>Accuracy is another very necessary qualification. Accuracy
is a habit&mdash;the habit of first finding the right way to do a thing, and
then doing it that way every time. The habit of doing a thing the
same way every time is very important in filing. If the rule is to file
all correspondence in the name of the firm from whom it is received,
no matter by whom signed, it is very essential that all letters from
the firm be filed in exactly the same way&mdash;not a part of them in the
name of the individual.</p>

<p>Accuracy is necessary also in placing letters in the files. Letters
that belong in the <i>Be</i> division of the index must be filed there&mdash;not
in the <i>Ba</i> division; letters intended for folder <i>No. 19</i> are to all intents
lost, if placed in <i>No. 91</i>.</p>

<p>To be able to read confusing chirography is a talent that is much
appreciated in more than one line of endeavor; it is especially valuable
to the file clerk. The signatures of many men are notoriously difficult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
to read, and large numbers of such signatures come to the filing
division of every concern having an extensive correspondence.</p>

<p>Spelling might seem to be an accomplishment not absolutely
essential to the equipment of a file clerk, but the ability to spell correctly
is very helpful. It is a great help in indexing. Especially
when a finely subdivided index is used, correct spelling is necessary
to determine the division under which a paper should be filed.</p>

<p>Speed is an absolute requirement. When the manager wants
a letter, he wants it at once. When the day's mail reaches the filing
division, it must be filed as quickly as possible. Some one may call
for a letter within an hour after it reaches the files, and to find it in the
unfiled correspondence means inevitable delay. Nowhere is prompt
service more thoroughly appreciated than in the filing division.</p>

<p>The importance of securing a file clerk with proper qualifications
is apparently overlooked in many offices. A girl is placed in
charge because she will work for a small salary, resulting&mdash;unless
she is qualified&mdash;in very poor service. An incompetent file clerk can,
in a short time, get the files in a demoralized condition almost impossible
to straighten out. The necessity of proper filing makes
the position one of real importance. On the other hand, the possibilities
of the position are seldom appreciated by the clerk. This
is due, perhaps, to the policy of making the position one of the lowest
in the office from the salary standpoint; but the greatest possibilities
of the position lie outside of the salary question.</p>

<p>The position of file clerk is a sure stepping stone to something
better&mdash;a more responsible and better paid position. No clerk in
the office has a better opportunity to obtain a general knowledge of
the business. From the stenographer who files the manager's personal
correspondence, to the clerk in charge of an extensive filing
division, each is intrusted with important papers revealing the very
secrets of the business. The position is a confidential one, and the
clerk who can absorb the information that must inevitably come to
his notice, and <i>keep the information to himself</i>, is surely preparing to
fill a higher position; he has a golden opportunity to demonstrate his
absolute trustworthiness.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The evolution of methods of filing is itself an interesting study.
From the days when the merchant preserved his bills and important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
letters by hanging them on a sharp-pointed hook, to the present with
filing cabinets of pleasing design and careful construction, in sizes
to hold papers of all shapes and kinds, there has been constant
progress. The advance of business methods, bringing with it an
ever-increasing volume of papers to be preserved, has resulted in a
demand for more simple methods&mdash;more scientific systems of filing.
Those confronted with a practical solution of the problem, and those
attempting to supply the demand, have devoted much time to a
study of the subject. This has brought into being the filing expert
who makes a study
of the filing problems
of concerns in
all lines of business.
The manufacturer
has kept pace with
the development,
and now is prepared
to furnish the right
device for filing
any document
from a small card
to the largest drawing
or map.</p>

<p>In this discussion of filing systems, it is not necessary to consider
the obsolete methods, even though they have at some time
been considered standard. The purpose of this discussion will be
better served by a study of the more modern systems.</p>

<p><b>Flat Files.</b> One of the filing systems still found in some offices
is the flat, or box file. This file is made in the form of a box, with a
hinged cover, as shown in Fig. 9. This box is of the right size to
hold letters without folding, and is equipped with an <i>A</i> to <i>Z</i> index.
Letters and other papers are filed between the index sheets in the order
of their receipt. Sometimes an attempt is made to keep all of the
correspondence of one person together but, since the letters are simply
laid in the file, with no means of separating those of the several correspondents
filed in one subdivision, it is very difficult to maintain
this arrangement.</p>

<p>Cabinets are also made with box drawers of wood, the number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
of drawers in a cabinet ranging from two to sixty. This permits
of the use of a more finely subdivided index, and better classification
of the contents. Each box in the cabinet is equipped with a spring
compressor which holds the contents in place. To file or remove
papers it is necessary to release this compressor. The index is
removable, and when the drawer is full, the index and contents are
placed in one of the box files referred to, which then becomes a transfer
case. A new index is placed in the file, which is then ready for
current correspondence.</p>

<p>This style of cabinet was for long the best to be had, but when
used for filing an extensive correspondence, its defects became
apparent. Among the disadvantages of its use, one of the chief is
the uneven filling up of the separate divisions. Where the alphabet
is divided among several drawers, one may fill up in two months, while
another is but half full at the end of a year. This means that the
transferring must be done whenever a single drawer is filled, instead
of transferring the contents of the entire file at one time, adding to
the difficulty of locating correspondence at a given date.</p>

<p>Other disadvantages are that correspondence is mixed together,
making it difficult to locate all of the correspondence of one person;
to remove a letter, the drawer must be taken from the file, and a
search made through all of the letters in a given subdivision of the
alphabet. Frequent transfers are necessary, resulting in an accumulation
of transfer files which occupy valuable space in the office.</p>

<p><b>Vertical Filing.</b> The vertical system of filing takes its name
from the fact that papers are filed vertically, on edge, instead of
being laid flat in a drawer. Vertical filing is the result of a gradual
evolution of filing methods.</p>

<p>Those who recognized the defects of the old systems, set about
to correct them. In the search for a remedy, all systems in use&mdash;for
whatever purpose&mdash;were carefully investigated, among others
the so-called <i>railroad system</i>. For years, railroads had been keeping
all correspondence relating to one subject together, attaching the
letters to a strong backing sheet. The sheet, with the letters attached,
was folded twice, making a package about 3½"×9" in size, which
package was known as a file. These files were numbered, and kept
in numerical sequence in pigeon holes, or in boxes similar to the
present-day document files. When the document boxes were used,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
which was the case in the larger offices, the packages or files
were placed on end&mdash;filed vertically. This undoubtedly was the
forerunner of the present-day vertical file.</p>

<p>The plan of keeping together all correspondence about a given
subject naturally appealed to the investigator as being practicable for
use in a commercial house. Not a few houses adopted the system
in its entirety, which included an alphabetically indexed book in
which a brief synopsis of the correspondence was written. The
book was also used for a cross-index to the names of individual correspondents.
It was really a system of recording the principal
contents of letters, with
references to the files
where all of the correspondence
could be
found.</p>

<div class="floatleft">
     <img src="images/ill-290.jpg" width="250" height="252"

         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 10. The Principle of Vertical Filing.<br /><i>Browne-Morse Co.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>While the idea of keeping
all of the correspondence
on one subject, or
with one individual, together,
was excellent,
this system was not well
adapted to commercial
use. Writing the contents
of letters in a book
was entirely impractical,
and too much time was
required to open the files and refer to the contents. But, said someone,
why not adopt the numerical idea, and substitute a numerical
for the alphabetical index in the box file; instead of index
sheets printed with the letters, why not have them numbered from
<i>1</i> up? Then a number could be assigned to each correspondent and
all of his letters could be filed under the index sheet bearing the
corresponding number. An index book could be used for the names
and references to the numbers.</p>

<p>Next came the card-index man with a proposition to use his
cards for an index to the files. Not long ago the writer inspected
a filing system consisting of a number of box files indexed numerically,
arranged on a shelf. A card index supplied the cross-references.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
In this particular case the system was designed by a card-index manufacturer
to create a market for card files.</p>

<p>But the use of card indexes furnished the final solution of the
filing problem. If small cards could be filed on edge, why not
letters? With a larger drawer, with index guides to fit, the card index
idea could be adapted to the filing of correspondence. Indeed, a
flat file drawer, standing on edge, as shown in Fig. 10, illustrates the
principle of vertical filing.</p>

<div class="floatright">
     <img src="images/ill-291.jpg" width="250" height="256"

         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 11. Folder for Vertical Filing<br /><i>Browne-Morse Co.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>To preserve the idea of keeping all correspondence of one individual
or firm together, folders are used. A folder, as shown in
Fig. 11, consists of a piece
of heavy manila paper
folded, with one edge higher
than the other, forming
a pocket 9¾"×11⅞" in
size. The higher or projecting
edge of the folder
is used for writing the name
of the correspondent or
other reference; or the
folder may be made with a
projecting tab for the
purpose.</p>

<p>One of these folders is
used for each correspondent.
Suppose, for example,
that correspondence develops
with Scott &amp; Blake. The name of the concern is written
on the projection of a folder, and all letters from, with copies of all
letters written to, Scott &amp; Blake are placed in this folder in the order
of their date&mdash;the last letter in front. The folder provides a complete
history of the correspondence with the concern.</p>

<div class="floatleft">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 12. Guides for Vertical Filing.<br /><i>Browne-Morse Co.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>The folders are filed on edge between guides or index cards
having projections on which the indexes are written or printed.
The indexes are fastened in a vertical file drawer, yet are removable.
On the bottom of the guide, Fig. 12, is a square-cut projection,
punched with a round hole. This projection drops into an opening
in the bottom of the drawer, and engages a countersunk rod which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
is passed through the hole. The rod holds the guide firmly in place,
but since the rod is removable, the guide can be taken out when it
is desired to
do so. The
folders are
not fastened
in any way,
and any folder
can be removed
without
disturbing
the others, as
shown in
Fig. 13.</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>Methods of
Indexing.</b>
There are
four principal
methods of indexing the vertical file; namely, the numerical, alphabetical,
geographical, and subject. These four methods, with
their resulting
combinations,
provide for the
proper indexing
of any class
of papers.</p>

<p><i>Numerical
Indexing.</i> Numerical
indexing
was the method
first used with
the vertical file,
and still is extensively
used.
With the numerical
system of indexing, the folders are numbered consecutively in
the upper right-hand corner. The folders are filed in numerical sequence
between guides, numbered usually by 10's, as shown in Fig. 14.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>Each correspondent is known by a number, and all of his correspondence&mdash;both
original letters and copies of replies&mdash;is filed in
a folder bearing his number. To locate his folder, a cross-index is
necessary, as it is not possible to remember the numbers of all correspondents.
The index is provided by a card on which is written
the name, the folder number or file number, and any other memoranda
that may be desired. The card is filed in a card drawer behind the
proper alphabetical index guide, where it can be found very quickly.</p>

<div class="floatleft">
     <img src="images/ill-293.jpg" width="250" height="236"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 14. Numerical Indexing<br /><i>Browne-Morse Co.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>Suppose, for example,
that correspondence
develops with B. J.
Anderson. We will file
his letter or a copy of
our reply in the next unused
numbered folder&mdash;which
happens to be
<i>No. 545</i>&mdash;and this will
be Mr. Anderson's number
as long as we have
any dealings with him.
Before placing the folder
in the proper place in
the file&mdash;following folder
<i>No. 544</i>, back of guide
<i>540</i>&mdash;we will write Mr. Anderson's name near the upper edge, and at
the same time we will fill out an index card as shown in Fig. 15. This
card will be filed in its proper place in the card index drawer, and
whenever we wish to refer to this correspondence we will turn to the
card, which shows that it will be found in folder <i>No. 545</i>.</p>

<p>When a letter refers to more than one person or subject, it is
filed under the most important. For example, when correspondence
develops with a firm, it should always be filed under the firm name,
even though the letters are signed by individuals. We will suppose
that one of our correspondents is the Norton Machine Co., and that
folder <i>No. 610</i> is assigned. Later, a letter signed by T. J. Watson,
Secretary, is received. Since the letter refers to the business of the
Norton Machine Co., it will be filed in their folder, and we will fill
out a cross-index card for T. J. Watson, Secretary, referring to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
company's folder, as shown in Fig. 16. This will be filed with the
other cards in the alphabetical card index, and will enable us to
locate the correspondence of T. J. Watson, even if we do not
remember the name of the company.</p>

<p><i>Alphabetical Indexing.</i> The alphabetical is the simplest method
of indexing. The guide or index cards are printed with the letters
of the alphabet, providing an alphabetical index between which the
folders are filed. Sets of alphabetical guides with any number of
subdivisions up to 4000 are to be had.</p>

<p>With the alphabetical system a folder is assigned to each regular
correspondent, as with the numerical system, but instead of a
number, only the name is written on the folder, or on the tab projection.
The folder is filed back of the proper alphabetical guide,
as in Fig. 17, and is used exclusively for that one correspondent.</p>

</div></div>

<p>It is the experience
of every business house
that a small correspondence
is received
from a large number of
persons. Perhaps but
one or two letters will
be received, the person
never developing into
a regular correspondent.
This correspondence
is treated as
miscellaneous. For
miscellaneous correspondence
a separate
folder, on which the
index letters are
written or printed, is used for each alphabetical subdivision. This
may be placed either behind or in front of the name folders, as in
Fig. 18.</p>

<p>The miscellaneous folder should not be allowed to become
too full. When a sufficient number of letters are accumulated with
a firm or individual, or whenever the nature of the correspondence
indicates that it is likely to become permanent, it should be transferred
to a separate folder.</p>

<p><i>Geographical Indexing.</i> When for any reason it is desirable
to have correspondence arranged according to territory, the geographical
system of indexing is used to excellent advantage. The
plan is exactly like alphabetical indexing, with the exception that the
files are divided according to territory. First, the files are divided
by states by means of state guides&mdash;indexes printed with the names
of the states. A very large concern may require guides for all states,
while a smaller business will use only three or four such divisions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
Or a concern doing business in a half-dozen states may find it advisable
to arrange the correspondence from but two of them territorially,
indexing the balance alphabetically. The correspondence from
a single state may require two or more drawers; or one drawer
may accommodate that from several states.</p>

</div></div>

<p>To subdivide the
states, guide cards
printed with the
names of the towns
are used. These are
arranged alphabetically
between the state
guides. Correspondence
folders are filed
back of the town
guides in alphabetical
sequence. If there is
a large number of
correspondents in one
town, the folders are
subdivided with a set of alphabetical guides. The geographical
method of indexing is shown in Fig. 19.</p>

States and Towns.<br /><i>Library Bureau</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>When the
correspondence
in a state is scattered,
with but
few correspondents
in each
town, a set of
alphabetical
guides can be
substituted for
the town guides.
In New York
state, for instance,
the letter
<i>A</i> would represent Albion, Attica, and other towns the names
of which begin with that letter. If there is a large town&mdash;as Albany&mdash;in
which there are a number of correspondents, a town guide should
be inserted in its proper place in the alphabetical index. Then, if
the correspondence from Albany is sufficient, it can be subdivided
with alphabetical guides, but these should be of a different color
than those representing the towns. The geographical index can
be expanded to any limit by inserting additional town and alphabetical
guides, wherever and whenever needed.</p>

<p><i>Subject Index.</i>
The subject index
is used whenever
the subject of the
correspondence is
more important
than the name of
the writer. Subject
indexing may be
used in connection
with the regular
correspondence.</p>

<p>When it is desired
to file by subjects
indexed numerically,
a numbered
folder is
headed with the
name of the subject,
and all correspondence
pertaining
to the subject is
filed in that folder.
An index card is
then filled in with
the name of the subject and the number of the folder, and filed
alphabetically. Additional cross-index cards are headed with the
names of correspondents, and refer to the subject and folder number.
Several subject index cards are shown in Fig. 20.</p>

<p>Subject filing can be adapted to the alphabetical index by inserting
folders or guides headed with the names of subjects, as shown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
in Fig. 21. These folders are used for correspondence pertaining to
a given subject, and cross-index cards are made for the names of
individuals.</p>

<p><b>Selecting the Index.</b> The selection of the index for correspondence
files is important, and must be governed by the nature of the
business, and the correspondence to be filed. Subject indexing is
the least used of any of the methods described. Railroads, and a
few large corporations determine as far as possible a number of
subject headings under
which all correspondence
shall be filed,
individuals being
known only in the
miscellaneous correspondence;
but these
are exceptions, and this
method of filing is not
adapted to the needs of
the average business
concern.</p>

<div class="floatleft">

</div></div>

<p>Geographical indexing
is quite largely
used by jobbers, and is a
very practicable method
for a concern whose correspondence is confined within a definite
territory. It is also used to advantage in connection with other
methods of indexing. For example, a concern in Chicago, with a
large number of customers in Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin, might
use a geographical index for those states, while filing all other
correspondence alphabetically.</p>

<p>This leaves alphabetical and numerical indexing from which
to make a selection. A thorough investigation, which has included
consultations with many leading filing experts, and examinations of
the systems used by more than a hundred representative houses,
from the small retail store to the largest corporations, leads to the
conclusion that, except in special cases, the alphabetical index is
best. It is best because simplest; and to do a thing in the most
simple way is one of the cardinal principles of business system.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>Alphabetical indexing adapts itself to every possible requirement.
Suppose, for example, that the correspondence of the Norton
Machine Company is filed alphabetically, and that you want to refer
to the correspondence of T. J. Watson, who is secretary of the company.
A cross-index card is headed with the name of the company.
This would be exactly like the cross-index shown in Fig. 16, except
that the number would be omitted.</p>

<p>There may be times when you will wish to keep together all
correspondence pertaining to a given subject&mdash;as a contract in which
you are interested. A folder can be made for this contract, headed
with the subject name, and filed in its proper place in the alphabetical
index. Cross-reference cards can be made, headed with the names
of individuals, and referring to the subject. Perhaps, when the contract
is completed, there will be no further reason for keeping the
correspondence together, and it can then be distributed according to
the regular alphabetical arrangement.</p>

<p>Should you wish to adapt the geographical idea to any part of
the correspondence, the alphabetical index lends itself to the change
without disturbing the general arrangement of the files. It can be
expanded to any size; any class of correspondence can be segregated;
and with properly subdivided indexes, papers can be quickly located.</p>

<p>Probably the two most important advantages of the alphabetical
over the numerical system of indexing are its economy of operation
and safety. As to the first named advantage, there is a saving at the
start in the outfit required. Only the letter file and alphabetical index
are needed&mdash;there is no investment in a card-index outfit, unless it
be a very small one for cross-references. But the greatest saving is
in the time required for its operation.</p>

<p>Without considering the operations involved in filing letters,
compare the two methods when a letter is wanted from the files.
Suppose that the file clerk has received a requisition for the correspondence
of the Norton Machine Company. With the numerical
index, the following steps are taken:</p>

         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 22. Alphabetical vs. Numerical Filing</p>
</div></div>

<p>This is merely an application of the principle that a straight
line is the shortest distance between two points, as illustrated in Fig. 22.</p>

<p>Alphabetical indexing is the safer for the reason that there is less
liability of filing a letter in the wrong place. With the numerical
system, the filing of letters in the wrong folder is not uncommon,
and when this is done the letters are practically lost.</p>

<p>The usual routine in numerical filing is first to place the folder
numbers on the letters, and then file according to these numbers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
without reference to the name. Naturally, the file clerk commits to
memory the numbers of a large part of the active correspondents,
and places them on the letters without referring to the card index.
Memory is ever fickle, and if the wrong number is placed on the
letter, it is probable that it will be filed accordingly.</p>

<p>In the use of figures, the most common of all errors is transposition,
and this is a constant source of danger in filing. Suppose,
for example, that in placing the number on a letter from the Norton
Machine Company, a transposition is made and the number reads
<i>160</i> instead of <i>610</i>. The letter is filed in folder <i>No. 160</i>, just four
hundred and fifty folders out of the way. The letter is practically
lost, for there is no way to locate it except to look through all of
the folders until it is found.</p>

<p>With the alphabetical index there is some danger of filing a
letter in the wrong place, but it is materially lessened by the fact
that the name must be kept in mind. If the letter is incorrectly filed,
it probably will be placed in a folder close to the right one. Almost
without exception, it will be found within two or three folders of its
proper place; there is scarcely a possibility that a letter from Norton
will be filed in White's folder.</p>

<h3 class="p2">MISCELLANEOUS FILING</h3>

<p><b>Salesmen's Correspondence.</b> The correspondence from salesmen
and branch houses is, as a rule, more bulky than that from even
the largest customers. A sub-divison should be provided that will
make it possible to locate quickly a letter of any date, without looking
through a great mass of correspondence. The most simple way to
accomplish this is to divide the correspondence of each salesman or
branch by months. A folder should be used each month.</p>

<p>Sufficient space should be provided in the general files to hold
salesmen's correspondence for an entire year. If subdivided by
months, old correspondence can be located much more quickly than
if scattered through several transfer files.</p>

<p>One way to reduce the bulk of this correspondence in the salesmen's
folders is to require each salesman to use a separate sheet for
each subject about which he writes. Nine out of every ten letters
from a salesman refer specifically to transactions with certain customers,
and are chiefly important in connection with the correspondence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
of those customers. Such letters should be filed in the customers'
folders, where they will be found when it is wished to investigate
transactions with a customer.</p>

<p>The correspondence of some very large customers is also quite
bulky. This, also, can be subdivided by the use of a new folder
each month. A similar plan is used to advantage in connection with
subject filing, a separate folder, filed back of the subject guide, being
used for each correspondent.</p>

<p><b>Correspondence of Temporary Value.</b> Every large enterprise
receives a considerable amount of correspondence which has no permanent
value. Inquiries for catalogs in response to advertising are
of no value unless further correspondence is developed. It is advisable
to set aside sufficient space in the files, and file such correspondence
alphabetically, in miscellaneous folders. Later, when further
correspondence develops, separate folders can be made and transferred
to the regular files. After a reasonable time&mdash;when the follow-up
is abandoned&mdash;the inquiries can be destroyed, saving space in
the permanent files.</p>

<p><b>Orders.</b> The manner of filing orders depends on the business
and the method of handling. It will depend on whether the greater
part of the orders are received direct from customers on their own
blanks, on blanks supplied by the house, or from salesmen on the
blanks of the house.</p>

<p>When orders are received direct from customers, whether in the
form of letters or on the customers' blanks, it is customary to copy
them on the house order blanks, from which orders are filled and
billed. The most practical disposition of customers' original orders
is to file them with their correspondence, instead of providing a special
file for them. There are certain exceptions, as subscriptions received
by a magazine and which, for certain reasons, should be kept by
themselves; but that outlined can be regarded as a general rule. One
reason for filing orders with the correspondence is that, in case of
dispute, it will very likely be necessary to refer to past correspondence.</p>

<p>The manner of filing the house blanks depends on the number
of copies made. Some houses make but two copies of the order&mdash;one
to be sent to the customer as an acknowledgment, and one from
which the order is filled. This leaves but one copy for the office,
and this should be filed numerically, which also brings it in the order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
of the date. If the order copy is also used as a posting medium, it
should be filed in a loose-leaf binder; otherwise a vertical file drawer
can be used.</p>

<p>Another very satisfactory method is to enter the order in triplicate&mdash;one
copy as an acknowledgment, an office copy, and a shipping
copy&mdash;leaving two copies for the files. One copy should be filed
numerically, the other alphabetically. This provides a cross-index
without the necessity of writing a card index, showing how easy it is
to provide valuable records by using ordinary care. A complete
order record is provided by making one extra copy, which is done
with no additional labor.</p>

<p>Orders received from salesmen on the house blanks are sometimes
used as a posting medium, in which case they are filed in a
binder, by date. Another method is to make the invoice in duplicate,
and use one copy
as a posting medium.
In such case,
the copy of the
order can be filed
alphabetically,
bringing all orders
from each customer
together.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 23. Special Invoice<br />Folder&mdash;Open
<i>Browne-Morse Co.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p><b>Invoices.</b> The
method of filing
invoices depends on whether or not a complete voucher system is
used. When no voucher system is used, all invoices should be filed
alphabetically in a vertical file. A folder should be used for each
firm or person from whom goods are purchased, so that all of their
invoices can be kept together. Invoices should be filed in the folder
in the order of their dates, the last one in front.</p>

<p>With the voucher system, invoices are sometimes attached to
the voucher, in which case they are filed according to the voucher
number and a separate card index is kept for alphabetical reference.
The more modern plan, however, is to file the voucher numerically,
retaining the alphabetical index for invoices.</p>

<p>Invoices can be filed in the same file with the correspondence,
or in a special file. When the former method is adopted a folder of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
a special color should be used. There would then be two folders
for a firm, one for invoices and one for correspondence. Special
folders with double folds are largely used for filing invoices, as shown
in Fig. 23.</p>

<div class="floatleft">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 24. Document File.<br /><i>Browne-Morse Co.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p><b>Documents and Legal Papers.</b> For filing documents and legal
papers, there are two standard methods. The older of the two is
to fold the papers and file them on end
in a document drawer, like the one shown
in Fig. 24. The drawer is equipped with
a compressor or following block for keeping
the papers in an upright position, and
either alphabetical or numerical indexes.
These drawers can be obtained singly
or in cabinets containing any number.</p>

<p>The more modern method is to file
documents and legal papers in a vertical
file, using document envelopes, as shown
in Fig. 25. These envelopes are of the
right size to hold legal papers flat, insuring
convenient reference, which is a decided improvement over the
older method of folding the papers. Any of the several methods of
indexing can be used, depending on the requirements of the business.</p>

<div class="floatright">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 25. Document File Envelopes<br /><i>Browne-Morse Co.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>As a filing system for the
lawyer's office, this method is
unsurpassed. Every record
of the office is kept in one
complete filing system, yet
each case is separate and distinct.
Every paper and all
correspondence relating to a
given case is filed, unfolded,
in one of the document envelopes&mdash;or
a folder can be
used&mdash;bringing all papers on the same subject together.</p>

<p>If indexed alphabetically, the papers are filed according to the
name of the client. When the numerical index is adopted, an alphabetical
index card with cross-references, including the docket index,
is used. The folders may be numbered by case or office numbers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
Copies of opinions can be filed in the same manner, making every
opinion available whether given yesterday or ten years ago. The
usual confusion in the lawyer's office, incident to the search for papers
scattered through several files, is entirely done away with.</p>

<p><b>Clippings.</b> The vertical system is the most practicable for filing
clippings, but, since they are liable to be lost through the open ends
of the ordinary correspondence folder, it is best to use either the
envelope or the invoice folder&mdash;preferably the former. Indexing
for clippings should
be by subject, and if
a file is used exclusively
for clippings, it
may be either numerical
or alphabetical.
As a rule, the latter
is most satisfactory,
though the former is
used quite extensively.</p>

<div class="floatright">

         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 26. Drawing or Map File<br /><i>C. J. Lundstrom Co.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>An envelope
should be used for
each subject. On the
front of the envelope
the name of the subject
and a list of the
contents is written. All clippings relating to that subject are filed in
the envelope, which is placed back of the proper alphabetical
guide. Cross-references, when needed, are provided by a card index.</p>

<p><b>Drawings and Maps.</b> A large concern, especially a manufacturing
enterprise, has a large number of drawings, blue prints, maps,
and photographs to file. One method is to file them in large folders,
laid flat in a flat drawer, using a card index for cross-reference.</p>

<p>A more convenient method is to file them vertically. The ordinary
vertical file drawer is too small for large drawings, but in Fig.
26 is shown a special file which will accommodate drawings measuring
24"×36". The drawings are filed in heavy folders, made to fit
the drawer. This drawer is hinged at its lower front edge, permitting
it to be opened by simply tilting the drawer forward, an operation
which is accomplished with very little exertion. The drawer is held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
in open position by an automatic catch which is quickly released
when it is desired to close the drawer. Each drawer is provided with
an adjustable follower which moves back as the space fills up. When
open the drawer exposes its entire contents, any of which may be
picked out instantly and again filed with the utmost convenience and
dispatch. When a large tracing is to be filed, it is desirable to first
pull out the folder to which it belongs and, after having placed the
tracing therein, to slip the folder back in its place. This prevents
any accidental creasing of the drawing.</p>

<p>Either an alphabetical or numerical index can be used, depending
on the class of drawings to be filed. In a machine shop, where all
machines and parts are known by number, the numerical index is
best. In a publishing house, where it is desired to keep all drawings
used for each book, they should be filed alphabetically by subject.</p>

<p><b>Credit Reports.</b> Vertical filing is best for credit reports, as it
brings together all credit information about a customer. Unlike
correspondence, it is customary to fasten credit reports in the folder
by using a drop of paste at the top of each report. A folder is used
for each customer, and all reports are attached in the order of their
date.</p>

<p>The index may be numerical, alphabetical, or geographical.
When the numerical system is used, a card index furnishes the cross-reference.
The card contains the name and the number of the folder,
with a brief history of the customer's dealings with the house.</p>

<h3 class="p2">FILING HELPS</h3>

<p><b>Guiding.</b> The importance of guiding should not be overlooked,
for guides are the great essential of a successful filing system. They
must be simple and correct. They must be inserted at sufficient
intervals to guide eye and hand instantly to the desired folder. A
vertical file drawer holds about 5000 letters, and, assuming that the
average is 10 letters to a folder, this would mean 500 folders. A
general rule is to use 50 guides to a drawer, or one guide for every
ten folders.</p>

<p>The estimate of the number of guides required should be liberal.
If there are 500 regular correspondents, it is better to equip the files
with a 60 subdivision alphabetical index than to confine it to a 50
subdivision index.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>Guides must stand hard usage and remain legible; therefore
the best quality should be used. All manufacturers of filing
equipment now supply guides of heavy pressboard with metal tips.
The metal tip guide is entirely rigid and supports the papers or
folders in the file, keeping them rigid and in alignment. An important
feature is that the index heading (name, letter, or number)
can be changed at any time by merely inserting a new slip in the
metal tip. Metal tip guides cost more than the old-style manila
guide stock, but in the
end are more economical.
The money paid
for a filing outfit should
be regarded as a permanent
investment; if
the expense is to be cut
down, let it be in the
purchase of supplies
used for transfer, rather
than in the regular files
which are used every day.</p>

<p><b>Transferring.</b> Correspondence
which is out
of date should be removed from the current file and filed in
transfer files or boxes, indexed as in the regular files. Transfers
should not be made too frequently. It is often advisable to use
cabinets large enough to hold the correspondence for two years, one
part being used for current correspondence, the other for correspondence
one year back. At the end of the year, all of the correspondence
is removed from the older file, which becomes the current file
during the succeeding year.</p>

<p><b>Sorting.</b> The work of the file clerk is facilitated and greater
accuracy insured by the use of a sorting tray, as shown in Fig. 27.
This consists of a wooden tray, equipped with alphabetical or numerical
guides according to the system used. For the alphabetical system
a set of <i>A</i> to <i>Z</i> guides&mdash;one for each letter of the alphabet&mdash;is used.</p>

<p>Before attempting to file, the clerk sorts the day's correspondence
in this tray. All correspondence belonging in one division of the
alphabet is thus brought together, and can be quickly filed.</p>

Sections.<br /><i>Browne-Morse Co.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>The selection of filing equipment has been greatly simplified
by the manufacturers, who have studied the filing problem with the
view to supplying the demand for equipment to accommodate every
business paper. As new problems have presented themselves, new
equipment has been designed. The needs of the smallest office, as
well as those of the largest corporation, have been studied and met.
Heavy cabinets of solid construction have given way to cabinets
built in sections, any one of which can be carried by the office boy.
The man who has but a
half-dozen letters a day to
file finds a section exactly
suited to his requirements;
as his business grows, he
adds other sections; the
cabinet grows with the
business, making one complete
system, no matter how
small or how large.</p>

<p>The most universally
used of all filing devices is
the vertical file. As has
been explained in the preceding
pages, it adapts itself
to almost all of the
papers found in a business
office. Vertical files are
made with drawers in three standard sizes: letter size, for ordinary
correspondence, or papers up to 9½"×11" in size; legal or cap
size, for legal blanks, reports, and other large papers up to 10"×15"
in size; invoice size, for invoices, orders, credit reports, and all
papers not larger than 5¼"×8". Papers 8"×10" can be
filed in the invoice size by folding once.</p>

<p><b>Styles of Construction.</b> Two standard styles of construction
are used for vertical files, horizontal sections and upright sections
or units. The horizontal section is made one vertical file drawer
high and either two or three drawers wide. Upright units are one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
drawer wide, four drawers high for letter and cap sizes, and five
drawers high for the invoice size.</p>

<p>The upright unit is the newer and preferred style of construction;
it is more substantial, and for either large or small filing systems
occupies less floor space. Upright units are put together as shown
in Fig. 28. Each section is built with skeleton ends, and at each end
of the cabinet&mdash;whether one or a dozen sections&mdash;end panels are used,
making one complete cabinet. The sections are locked together,
and can be separated at will. Fig. 29 shows three upright sections,
in the three standard sizes, joined together to make a complete cabinet.
This gives some indication
of the possibilities
offered by this style of
construction in building
a cabinet to meet every
requirement.</p>

<i>Browne-Morse Co.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>Upright units are
also made with combinations
of drawers for
different purposes. For
a small business, an assortment
of files for
different purposes is
frequently desirable. An
entire section filled with
files of one kind may not
be needed, but a combination
section offers a solution. The combination illustrated in
Fig. 30 contains one cupboard, six shallow storage blanks, two
double card-index drawers, and three document files. A vertical
file drawer can be substituted for the cupboard unit.</p>

<p>If vouchers, or other folded documents are to be filed, the document
drawers shown in the combination unit can be used, or provision
can be made for filing these papers in the vertical file. The vertical
file drawer is divided lengthwise by partitions into compartments
of the same width as the document file. Each compartment is
equipped with a follower block and countersunk rod for holding
guides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

</div></div>

<p>Where a large number of folded documents are to be filed, as
in the office of a corporation using a voucher system, this file is much
more convenient than the old style. An old-style document file has
a limited filing capacity, and must
be taken from the cabinet for
consultation. A vertical file
drawer, legal size, provides three
compartments, each 24" in
length. This gives an actual
filing capacity of six feet in a
single drawer. An upright
section, equipped for document
filing, is shown in Fig. 31. If an
entire section is not needed for
this purpose, one drawer can
be equipped for document filing,
and the others used for correspondence.</p>

</div></div>

<p>A style of construction designed
to combine the expansion
idea with variety is known as
the <i>inter-inter cabinet</i>. This
cabinet consists primarily of an outer cabinet or shell of standard
height, depth, and width. This shell is divided into compartments
of standard height into which the filing devices are fitted.
The various filing devices are arranged in skeleton units of standard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
dimensions, made interchangeable so that any desired combination
can be produced. Fig. 32 shows an outside cabinet, card
index, and vertical file units, which fit the openings in the cabinet.</p>

<div class="floatleft">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 32. Inter-Inter Construction<br /><i>Macey Co.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>This construction enables the user to make a combination of
small units of various kinds to suit present requirements, all housed
in a single case in a compact form. Provision for future expansion
is unnecessary, since an additional outside cabinet can be added at
any time, and the units rearranged at will to conform with changes
in the system.</p>

<p>An inter-inter cabinet shown in Fig. 33 suggests the variety of
devices that can be accommodated in a single shell. This cabinet
contains vertical file, card index, legal blank drawers, and document
files.</p>

<p>The need has been felt for a small filing cabinet, or stack of
sections, that would be complete and give the proper variety. The
professional man, the department manager, and the executive have
need for a small cabinet for personal correspondence, reports, statistics,
records of matters requiring personal attention, blanks and forms,
private papers, and all matters of a confidential nature. This need
seems to have been met satisfactorily by the small sections known to
the trade as <i>sectionets</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<div class="floatleft">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 33. Inter-Inter Cabinet<br /><i>The Macey Co.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>These are complete sections, the largest size being that of the
vertical file drawer, which can be stacked one on top of the other
or side by side. Any of the standard filing devices can be made
up into these sections. A small section for 4"×6" cards is shown
in Fig. 34. A single section, with top
and base, makes a complete cabinet,
which can be added to as needed. Fig.
35 shows a small stack of sections
consisting of vertical file, 5"×8" card
index, and 3"×5" card-index drawers,
and one document file, on a leg base.</p>

<p><b>Transfer Files.</b> Files for the storage
of transferred correspondence can be of
cheaper construction than the regular
filing cabinets, as they are less frequently
referred to and not subject to the same
hard usage. They should, however, be
of reasonably substantial construction;
it is usual to keep business correspondence
at least two years, and it may be
necessary to refer to it many times
after it is transferred. Then, too, if
substantial transfer files are provided,
they can be used again and again;
sufficient transfer files to hold two
years' correspondence will last indefinitely.</p>

<div class="floatright">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 34. Card Sectionet<br /><i>Shaw-Walker Co.</i>]</p>
</div></div>

<p>At first, manufacturers of vertical
filing equipment supplied nothing more
substantial than boxes made of binder's
board. Boxes the size of a
vertical file drawer were used.
These were usually stored on
shelves, and to refer to the
contents it was necessary to
take down the box and remove
the cover. To keep
pace with improvements in
filing cabinets, new styles of transfer files have been perfected.
One of the most satisfactory of the more modern styles is the drawer
transfer file, which is practically a single drawer section. It is made
of light wood with a drawer as shown
in Fig. 36. These files can be stacked,
one on top of another, and locked together,
making a solid filing cabinet.
The drawers hold the contents of a vertical
file drawer, but are not equipped
with follower blocks, and are not recommended
for current filing. These
transfer files cost more than the old style,
but when durability and accessibility
are considered, they probably are more
economical in the long run.</p>

<p><b>Metal Files.</b> Metal furniture is rapidly
gaining in popularity for office use. All
sorts of office furniture is now made of
sheet steel&mdash;desks, tables, chairs,
counters, and filing devices for all purposes.
Metal cabinets are made in upright
sections and equipped with the
same filing devices found in wooden cabinets. Fig. 37 shows a row
of metal sections, combining a variety of filing devices. At either
end are roller book shelves and a cupboard, while in the center are
six styles of files.</p>

<p>The most apparent advantage of metal files is the safety afforded,
as it has been amply demonstrated that they will go through a very
severe fire without damage to contents. Few offices have sufficient
vault space for the papers that must be kept. Metal files not only
take care of the valuable papers, but by keeping all papers away from
combustible material, act as a fire preventive.</p>

<p>Another reason for the increasing popularity of metal files is
the scarcity of suitable timber and its advancing cost. The supply
of oak and mahogany is decreasing so rapidly that the necessity for a
substitute seems inevitable in the near future. For office furniture
steel seems to offer the most practical substitute.</p>

<h2 class="p4">BUSINESS STATISTICS</h2>

<h3 class="p2">STATISTICAL DEPARTMENT</h3>

<p>One of the chief functions of the comptroller's office is to gather
statistics which tell what is being done in every branch, department,
and division of the business. The purpose of these statistics is to show
the results of these activities&mdash;the gross volume of transactions, the
cost, and the result in net profits. When assembled in the form of
intelligent reports, these statistics present an understandable history
of the business.</p>

<p>The statistical department may be considered as the cost department
of the commercial branch. Manufacturers recognize the necessity
for comprehensive statistics in the manufacturing branch; they
realize that they must know what their goods cost to manufacture;
but in comparatively few enterprises is the importance of commercial
costs recognized.</p>

<p>In the factory, costs are figured down to the most minute detail;
what it costs to perform each operation on every part of the completed
whole is known; the efficiency of every man&mdash;what he costs in wages,
in power, and general expense, and the cost of every bit of material
he uses&mdash;all of this is told by the cost accounting system. What it
costs to sell the goods is usually a matter of guess work.</p>

<p>To know what it costs to run a business&mdash;to know <i>commercial
costs</i>&mdash;is just as important as to know manufacturing costs. Both
are necessities if the business is to attain its greatest possibilities.</p>

<p>What are the actual profits of this or that department?</p>

<p>How much net profit is there in handling this commodity?</p>

<p>Does it cost more to send a salesman to that little town, ten miles
off the main line, to take Jones' order than the profits on his business?</p>

<p>Is there as much profit in working <i>this</i> territory as some other?</p>

<p>Measured by the standard of <i>net profits</i>&mdash;not volume of sales&mdash;is
Brown a profitable salesman? Compared with White, what is
his efficiency?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>These are some of the questions to be answered before it can
be claimed that the statistical department has reached its highest
state of efficiency. The success of modern merchandising is measured,
not by the volume of business transacted, but by profits. In
days gone by, the merchant liked to be able to say that he sold more
goods last year than any of his competitors; today he is better pleased
if he has made the most money. A net profit of 10% on a business
of $500,000.00, is more attractive than a million-dollar business without
profit.</p>

<p>Commercial costs may be divided into two classes&mdash;sales costs
and administrative costs. Of the two, sales costs are the more important;
if sales costs are not kept down, there will be nothing left
from which to pay administrative costs.</p>

<p><b>Sales Costs.</b> In the broadest interpretation, sales costs include
every expense properly chargeable to the sale of goods. For statistical
purposes it may very properly be divided into direct and
indirect, or general selling expense. Direct sales expense is made up
of salaries and traveling expenses of salesmen&mdash;items which can be
definitely determined and charged against definite sales. Indirect
sales expense is made up of advertising, salaries of the sales manager
and his office assistants, expense of entering orders and billing, packing
and shipping expense, and all similar items properly chargeable
to the expense of marketing the goods&mdash;items which, while chargeable
to sales, cannot be applied directly to individual sales, nor to specific
territories.</p>

<p>Figuring sales costs is a specific function of the statistical department
which is sometimes referred to as <i>profit figuring</i>&mdash;an appropriate
term, since the principal object of gathering sales statistics is
to determine profits. As a preliminary to figuring profits, it is necessary
to have an accurate record of the <i>cost</i> of the goods sold. In a
manufacturing enterprise, it is expected that this information will be
supplied by the cost department; in a trading business, the statistical
department must make the calculations.</p>

<p>The first step is to obtain a record of all goods received. This
can be done most easily by obtaining duplicate invoices, which will
be supplied by those from whom goods are purchased, if insisted
upon. To the invoice must be added the freight and cartage&mdash;items
which must be supplied by the accounting department. This gives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
the total cost, laid down, and should be divided to show costs per
unit&mdash;as yards, dozen, pounds, barrels, or tons. On a mixed shipment
it is not difficult to apportion the freight to the different commodities.
Every freight bill shows the rate at which the shipment is
billed, and the total can be apportioned by weight on the same basis.</p>

<p>To insure a permanent record of cost prices, it is best to register
each shipment received, with its cost. This register should be divided
according to commodities, providing a separate record of each one.
A loose-leaf book is best for the purpose.</p>

<p>A suitable form is shown in Fig. 1. This sheet is headed with
the name of the article or commodity, and each sheet is used for a
record of receipts of a single article. The record includes date of
invoice, date received, from whom, lot number, quantity, price,
amount of invoice, freight and cartage, total cost, and cost per unit.
Each lot of goods received is given a lot number, these numbers being
consecutive for each commodity.</p>

<p>The sheet serves the double purpose of a record of receipts and
a price list. Both the quantity and total columns are footed, the
footings being carried forward to the end of the month. All sheets
are filed alphabetically by commodities, subdivided by departments,
the current sheets always being on top.</p>

<p><b>Records of Shipments.</b> Before sales costs and profits can be
figured, the statistical department must be supplied with records
of shipments. This may be accomplished by providing an extra
copy of the invoice, which is easily done with modern billing systems.
To save transcribing, the copy for the statistical department should
be wider than the original invoice. The extra width allows for the
addition of special columns needed in figuring profits on the shipment,
as shown in Fig. 2. This form has added columns for total
cost, gross profits, sales expense, net profits, and per cent of net
profits.</p>

<p>When these invoice copies are received in the statistical department,
the price lists, Fig. 1, are referred to for cost prices. Here
the use of the lot number assumes importance, as prices are obtained
for the specific lot numbers shown on the invoice, resulting in actual
rather than estimated profit figures.</p>

<p>After serving their purposes in the tabulation of other data,
explained later, the invoice copies are filed alphabetically, keeping
all invoices to the same customer together. Either a vertical file or
a post binder may be used for this purpose.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Returned Goods.</b> Another very important record in profit
figuring is that of returned goods. Profits may be figured on the
invoices, but if accurate profits on the business of a customer or a
salesman are to be recorded, returned goods must be considered.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 2. Copy of Invoice for Statistical Department</p>
</div></div>

<p>When goods are returned, it means a loss of anticipated profits,
and should be considered in the same light as an actual loss. In a
well-managed business, returned goods are kept down to a minimum;
if they increase above normal, an investigation into causes is in order.
Repeated returns of the same merchandise indicate a defect in the
merchandise itself; if those from the territory of one salesman are
frequent, an inquiry into the salesman's methods is necessary&mdash;he
may have the fault of loading his customers too heavily, or of
adding to their orders&mdash;all of which are added reasons why a record
of returns should be kept.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>A blank for a monthly record is shown in Fig. 3. This record
shows the name of the department from which the goods were sold,
the commodity, name of customer, price at which sold, the cost&mdash;including
selling cost&mdash;the loss, and the name of the salesman. From
this sheet, all data necessary for complete records can be tabulated.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 3. Report of Returned Goods</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>Salesmen's Records.</b> One of the special benefits&mdash;perhaps
the chief benefit&mdash;of a profit-figuring department is a record of the
work of each salesman. Not merely the volume of his sales, but the
profits on those sales, measure his worth to the house.</p>

<p>The salesman whose sales are largest in quantity, or even in
dollars and cents, is not necessarily the best salesman. One man
may sell a thousand dollars' worth of sugar, while another sells two
hundred dollars' worth of tea and makes more money for the house;
one strives for volume&mdash;making price concessions to secure a big
order&mdash;while the other is content with smaller sales at a good profit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>In the final analysis, profits determine the efficiency of the salesman.
His salary may be large or small; his expense high or low;
but he is not efficient unless his business shows a net profit.</p>

<p>To tabulate the sales of each salesman, so that a complete record
of his work may be seen at a glance, is then, of the utmost importance.
The first step should be to make a record of <i>what</i> he sells&mdash;how much
calico and how much silk. On a loose-leaf sheet, ruled as shown in
Fig. 4, a record of a salesman's sales of a single commodity may be
kept; from these sheets, a record of his total sales can be tabulated.</p>

<p>The head of this sheet shows the name of the commodity, the
name of the salesman, and the month covered by the record. A
detailed record is kept of each day's sales, showing quantity, cost,
sales, gross profits, and per cent of gross profit. At the end of the
month returns are deducted&mdash;the information being obtained from
the returned goods report, Fig. 3, leaving the net record. This sheet,
which is loose-leaf, is filed alphabetically by salesman's name, the
sheets for each man being in alphabetical order by commodities.</p>

<p>A record of the salesman's total business is made on the loose-leaf
form shown in Fig. 5. This record is made up from the totals
of the commodity records, Fig. 4, and the form has the same columns,
with an additional column, headed <i>% of total</i>. In this column is
entered the per cent which the total sales of each commodity bears
to the salesman's total sales. The profits on the salesman's business
usually increase in direct ratio to the increase in the per cent of
sales of the higher-priced specialties.</p>

<p>This total record is, of course, made up at the end of the month,
only the monthly totals being shown. A recapitulation is made at
the bottom of the sheet. In the right-hand, or credit, column the
gross profit is brought down; in the left-hand column, sales expense
is entered, the several items being separated. First, the salary of the
salesman and the amount of his traveling expenses are entered and
footed, the total being the direct sales expense. Following this is
entered the general sales expense that should be charged against the
business of the salesman, this item being supplied by the accounting
department. The total sales expense is then extended in the credit
column and deducted from gross profits, leaving net profits&mdash;the
real measure of the salesman's value.</p>

<p>These sheets should be filed in the same binder with the salesman's
commodity sales records. A separate index may be used, or
they may be filed on top of the commodity sheets, bringing the
entire month's record together. To make identification easy, they
should be of a different color from the commodity sheets.</p>

<p>Sales records such as these give a complete history of the business
of each salesman; they tell the whole story in language most easily
understood by the manager. The longer they are kept, the more
valuable the history becomes.</p>

<p><b>Mail Orders.</b> In a business in which occasional mail orders are
received, sales of this character may be grouped under some such
caption as <i>home office</i>, and treated in the statistical records in the
same manner as the sales of one salesman. Where an extensive
mail-order department is maintained, it may be advisable to keep
records of the business of each mail-order salesman.</p>

<p><b>Expense Distribution.</b> General sales expense must be distributed,
on some equitable basis, over the total sales. There are
two logical factors on which this distribution may be made, <i>total sales</i>
and <i>cost of goods sold</i>. The latter seems to be the most equitable.
If based on total sales, the distribution may actually penalize the
salesman who is really the most profitable. For example, one salesman
may sell for $2000.00 goods which cost $1500.00, while another
will obtain $2200.00 for the same goods; if the expense is distributed
on the basis of total sales, a larger amount is charged against the business
of the latter salesman when the increase is all profit. On the
basis of cost, the same amount would be charged against the business
of both salesmen.</p>

<p>When the total sales expense and total cost of goods sold is ascertained,
the former is divided by the latter amount to obtain the correct
percentage. This is then added to the cost of sales of each salesman.</p>

<p>While, as a rule, general sales expense should be charged against
the cost of <i>all</i> goods sold, there are certain exceptions when a part
of this expense should be charged against specific sales. For example,
a manufacturer may make a special appropriation for advertising
his product in a certain state, using local papers, street cars, and bill
boards. In that case the advertising is very properly chargeable
against the business from that state; though it might be advisable
to distribute the amount over several months.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>A mail-order department involves certain expenses, none of
which are chargeable against the business produced by the salesmen.
Included in this special expense are such items as postage, stationery,
printing, and stenographers' salaries. This expense should be
charged against the business of the department and, if records of the
work of each salesman are kept, it must be <i>prorated</i> on the basis of
cost of goods sold by each.</p>

<p><b>Total Commodity Sales.</b> A record of the total sales of each
commodity is necessary in order that the profit in handling the
commodity may be determined. Sometimes it is found that a commodity
which is apparently being sold at a profit is actually sold at
a loss, when the actual selling costs are determined. Or, one salesman
may sell the commodity at a loss, while others sell it at a profit.</p>

<p>The form shown in Fig. 6 is used for a summary of the sales
of one commodity. At the end of the month one of these sheets is
headed with the name of each commodity and the totals entered from
the salesman's commodity records, Fig. 4. Opposite the name of
each salesman is entered the quantity and amount of his sales, following
which is an important column headed <i>% of whole</i>. In this
column is entered the percentage which the sales of the one salesman
bear to the total sales of the commodity. If Bacon sells 40% of all the
tea sold by the house, it is shown by this report; if he sells 50% of the
sugar, it is shown just as plainly. Not only how much of a given commodity
is sold, but who sold it, is recorded on this monthly summary.</p>

<p>In the columns following total sales, the total cost and gross
profits are entered. From the gross profit is deducted the sales expense&mdash;this
being calculated on the percentage shown for total
sales expense in the recap at the bottom of the salesman's sheet,
Fig. 5, leaving the net profit. In the last column, the per cent of net
profit is entered. The footing at the bottom of the sheet shows total
amounts and the percentages of sales expense, and net profits are
calculated on the basis of these totals; this gives the average expense
and profit on the total volume of sales.</p>

<p><b>Department Sales.</b> Next in importance to a knowledge of profits
on a single commodity is a knowledge of the results produced by
a department. This necessitates a record of departmental sales.
Sales and profits measure the efficiency of a department, just as they
do of a salesman.</p>

<p>The necessity for departmental records depends on the business.
A manufacturer who produces but two or three articles needs
only records of sales of commodities; a wholesaler requires records
of sales of classes of goods. In a wholesale business, departmental
divisions are distinct; each department is in charge of a head, and
the record of the department is his record.</p>

<p>In a comparison of departmental profits, the percentage of net
profits should not be followed blindly. Certain departments are
not money makers. To a certain extent it is possible to discontinue
unprofitable lines, or even departments, but in some businesses it
is necessary to maintain departments which are not profitable. In
the dry goods business&mdash;either wholesale or retail&mdash;the margin of
gross profit in notions is so small that it is doubtful if, when all legitimate
expense is deducted, a net profit is realized. The salesman for
a wholesale house whose sales of notions is largest, has made the poorest
record; the manager who has kept the sales of the notion department
at the lowest price&mdash;at the same time keeping his stock down&mdash;may
be the most efficient.</p>

<p>For a record of departmental sales the form shown in Fig. 7
may be used. The data for this report is secured from the commodity
records, Fig. 6. For each commodity, the quantity and total
amount of sales are entered. Following this is a per cent column in
which is entered the ratio which the sale of each commodity bears
to the total sales of the department. The columns which follow are
the same as on the commodity sales records. A loose-leaf form should
be used, and this may be filed with the commodity records&mdash;the
departmental record on top, with the commodity records arranged
alphabetically underneath.</p>

<p>The forms described provide detailed records of the business
of each salesman and each department (classified by commodities),
records of goods received, and of returned goods. From these records,
complete trading statements can be made for each department, or
for the entire business.</p>

<p><b>Trading Statements.</b> Reports in the form of trading statements
made from these records give the manager the facts in which he is
specially interested; they show him the profits of the business and
the sources of the profits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>A monthly trading statement should be made for each department,
in order that the total operations may be seen at a glance.
All of the essential facts are shown on the department report, Fig. 7,
but a properly constructed trading statement affords an opportunity
for valuable comparisons. While the fact that a department has
made a net profit of $7864.20 this month is interesting, these figures
take on added interest when compared with last month's profits.</p>

<p>A form for a monthly departmental trading summary is shown
in Fig. 8. In this form, the trading statement for the current month
is entered in the two columns headed <i>trading</i>. First, the total
amount of sales is entered in the credit column; then the value of
stock on hand at the beginning of the month is entered on the next
line, in the debit column. When the profit-figuring department is
organized, it is necessary to have an accurate inventory in each department
that this trading statement may be started correctly. If
started on a correct basis, the record becomes perpetual. To the
amount on hand is added the value of goods received, as shown by
the merchandise received reports, Fig. 1. From the total, the value
of the inventory at the end of the month is deducted, the remainder
being known as the <i>turnover</i>&mdash;the cost or inventory value of goods
sold. To find the value of the inventory an actual count of the
goods on hand is unnecessary. The value may be found by deducting
from the total the value, at cost, of goods sold, which is the footing
of the total cost column, Fig. 7. This inventory is, of course, the
amount shown as on hand at the beginning of the next month.</p>

<p>The difference between the <i>turnover</i> and <i>sales</i> is the <i>gross profit</i>&mdash;being
the amount necessary to balance the debit and credit columns.
The gross profit is brought down and entered in the credit column.
Sales expense is entered in the debit column, the difference between
this amount and gross profits being <i>net trading profit</i>, for the current
month.</p>

<p>The three columns at the right are for comparative figures.
In the column headed <i>to date</i> is entered the total sales, turnover,
gross profits, expense, and net profits from the beginning of the
current fiscal year to date; in the two columns next following, the
same facts are entered for last month and last year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>As a rule, these monthly trading statements for each department
give the manager just the information he wants; but, when
there are a large number of departments, it is sometimes advisable
to tabulate these statements, giving one complete record. A form
for such a report is shown in Fig. 9. No detailed explanation of
this report is necessary, the columns being arranged for the same
information as given on the department statement. The only exception
is the inventory column, which is intended for the current
inventory only. In the three comparative columns at the right, net
profits only are entered. This statement gives a history of sales in a
nut shell.</p>

<p><b>Customers' Profit Records.</b> To know the value of each customer,
as measured by the profits on his business, is as important as a knowledge
of the value of each salesman. It is for the purpose of obtaining
this information that columns for calculating net profits are added
to the statistical department's copy of the invoice, Fig. 2.</p>

<p>Detailed records of purchases of each customer, divided by
commodities, are unnecessary, but there should be a summary showing
total purchases and profits. Detailed information about individual
shipments and separate commodities can be obtained from
the invoice copies.</p>

<p>Fig. 10 shows a form for a customer's record on a 4-in. X 6-in.
card. This form provides for monthly records only. At the end
of the month the total purchases and total profits are obtained from
the invoice copies, and the amounts entered on the card. The card
is ruled for a two-years' record.</p>

<p>These cards should be filed geographically, the name of the town
heading the card. If there are several customers in a town, their
cards should be arranged in alphabetical order. State boundaries
need not be followed; it is usually better to file the cards according
to salesmen's territories. This makes a combined customers' and
territorial file, and if a record of the business in a town or state is
wanted, it can be obtained from the cards. If desired, a new card
can be inserted for a total record of each town or group of towns.</p>

<p><b>Value of Profit Figuring.</b> The value of the records described
can scarcely be overestimated. To know the profit-making ability of
each department and each salesman; to read at a glance the value of
every town and every customer; to know the cost value of goods sold
and the exact condition of the stock at the end of every month, these
are the facts which enable a manager to size up his business.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>The man who lacks these facts&mdash;who is obliged to wait for them
until the end of the year, and then get only a part of them, does
not have a grasp of his business, and cannot expect to bring it to the
highest possible state of efficiency. That more managers have not
insisted on having these facts before them is doubtless due to one or
both of two causes: <i>failure to appreciate their value</i>; and <i>the belief
that dependable statistics of this sort were unobtainable without too
great an expenditure of labor</i>. Neither is borne out; all the evidence
is to the contrary.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 10. Record of Purchases and Profits of a Customer</p>
</div></div>

<p>As to their value, little need be said. The fact that the most
extensive enterprises find it profitable to compile statistics setting
forth the most minute operations in every department is sufficient
evidence of the value of corresponding statistics to the smaller merchant
or manufacturer. If a great railway system finds it not only
profitable but necessary to compile statistics showing the cost of repairs
per ton-mile for every engine in its service, arranged for a comparison
of the efficiency of individual locomotives, surely the merchant will
find it profitable to analyze his profits. An analysis of the profits
and losses of a wholesale grocer, showing how much he has made
on tea; how much he has lost on sugar; what profit has been produced
by a certain salesman; the profit value of a customer, is of as great
value to him as a knowledge of the cost of repairs on an individual
car to the officials of a railway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>To the man who has made no attempt to secure them, the compilation
of these statistics may seem an endless task, not justified
by their value. Actually, the magnitude of the task is, to a great
extent, governed by desire; a man is quite likely to obtain what
he really wants, and as his desires increase the difficulties decrease.</p>

<p>When it comes to the actual work of preparing these statistics,
the difficulties are found to be really minor ones. The main thing
is to do the work every day; to record the transactions of a single day
does not involve an undue amount of labor, but if allowed to get
behind, the task assumes appalling proportions.</p>

<p>Modern billing systems make it possible to tabulate certain of
these statistics when the bills are made. The adding machine is
also of inestimable value in statistical work; computations which
would involve a whole day of hand-and-brain work are made in an
hour on a modern adding or calculating machine.</p>

<p>In deciding what statistics should be compiled, the nature and
needs of the business must be considered. It is usually unnecessary
to use as the unit a single brand of a given commodity. A
wholesale grocer, for instance, would not find it necessary to make
separate records of each brand, or even each article, in canned goods.
They would be divided into classes&mdash;as vegetables, fruits, and meats,
and each class would be treated in the records as a single commodity.
When taking on an entirely new line, he might wish to compile separate
statistics for a time, but when the fact that the line is a profitable
one has been established, the special statistics would be unnecessary.</p>

<p>Again, one house will find it advisable to go into certain details
not considered necessary in another establishment. For example,
one house has, as a result of the facts revealed by their statistical
department, established a system of bonuses to their salesmen based
on the profit percentages of their business. This necessitates a
record different from any of those that have been shown. This concern
has grouped the goods in each department according to percentages
of gross profits&mdash;as 5%, 10%, 20%, 25%, etc. Each salesman
is given a monthly quota&mdash;based on salary, territory, and previous
sales&mdash;which he is expected to reach. This quota specifies not
only the amount of sales but the percentage of profit; each $100.00
of sales is expected to include not more than a certain amount of 5%
goods, nor less than a given amount of 25% goods, the exact ratio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
of each being given. If a salesman exactly equals his quota, maintaining
the percentage prescribed, he is given a small bonus; if he
exceeds his quota and maintains the prescribed percentages, or
increases the percentage of sales of the more profitable goods, his
bonus is increased in proportion to the increased profits&mdash;the greater
the percentage of profits, the more rapid the increase in the bonus.
On the other hand, if his sales of goods sold at a small profit increase,
he is penalized by being denied a bonus, no matter what the volume
of his sales.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-343.jpg" width="400" height="336"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 11. Salesman's Comparative Sales Statement</p>
</div></div>

<p>This bonus system, which is an adaptation of the bonus wage
system used in factories, has the effect of increasing the sale of the
most profitable goods. When a customer places an order for goods
in which there is little profit, the salesman&mdash;who cannot refuse the
order&mdash;is given an incentive to push the sale of more profitable goods;
he must do so as a matter of self-protection.</p>

<p>To determine the bonuses, statistical statements differing from
those already shown are necessary. These statements must divide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
sales according to percentage groups, rather than by commodities,
as shown in Fig. 11. The data for this statement is taken from the
commodity sales statement, Fig. 4, and with an adding machine can
be tabulated very quickly.</p>

<p>Another house, which does an exclusive mail-order business,
keeps accurate records of the sales resulting from circular letters,
charging the cost of the letters, including postage, to those sales.
Records are also kept of the sales of each correspondent. When
an order is received, the correspondence record is examined and, if
the order is in response to a dictated letter, the correspondent receives
credit. Each correspondent is required to keep a record of the number
of dictated and form letters that he uses, the cost of which is
charged against his sales. At the end of the month results are tabulated
showing the percentage of orders secured from circular letters
and from dictated letters; the amount of business from each letter
of each correspondent; and the percentage of cost to the cost of goods
sold.</p>

<p>These and many other statistics can be tabulated, and for each a
special form is needed. The classes of information to be presented
in statistical form depend on the business. When it has been determined
what information will be of greatest value, forms should be
prepared which will make it possible to tabulate the desired facts
with the least labor.</p>

<h3 class="p2">ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS</h3>

<p>Commercial costs which are not chargeable to sales are classed
as administrative, and may be divided into <i>executive</i>, <i>accounting</i>,
<i>office expense</i>, <i>credits</i>, and <i>collections</i>.</p>

<p>In a strictly trading business, <i>purchasing</i> is an added division,
while in a manufacturing enterprise it is usual to consider this a
manufacturing expense.</p>

<p><i>Executive</i> expense is made up of the salaries of the general manager
and comptroller, salaries of clerks and stenographers, and a
proper portion of miscellaneous expense. In a manufacturing business,
a part of the executive salaries is charged to manufacturing.</p>

<p><i>Accounting</i> expense includes the salaries of chief accountant
and cashier, clerks and stenographers, blank books and supplies,
and miscellaneous expense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Office</i> expense is charged with the salary of the chief stenographer,
and the expense of mailing and filing, including salaries of clerks.</p>

<p><i>Credits</i> and <i>collection</i> expense include the salaries of the credit
man and his clerks, the cost of mercantile agency service and reports,
and the cost of collections, including postage.</p>

<p><i>Purchasing</i> expense, which, as stated, sometimes is a commercial
expense, includes the salaries of purchasing agent, receiving
clerk, stores clerk and their assistants, and the entire expense of the
storeroom.</p>

<p>In a strictly trading business, such items as power, heat and light,
insurance and taxes&mdash;usually a manufacturing expense&mdash;become
administrative expense. These, and all similar items, are grouped
under the head of <i>miscellaneous</i>, to be distributed over all divisions of
commercial costs.</p>

<p>In the main, the different divisions of administrative costs are
easily assembled. In each division there is the salary of the department
head, the total of which is charged to the division, and a correct
apportionment of salaries which must be divided among two or more
divisions. For illustration, the salaries of stenographers are distributed
as has already been explained. By far the larger part of
this expense is charged to the advertising and sales departments,
but from the weekly reports of this division, the amount to be charged
to the executive, accounting, credit and collection, and purchasing
divisions may be obtained.</p>

<p><i>Mailing Costs.</i> In the division of office expense one item which
must be distributed, at least between sales and administrative, is
mailing expense. Mailing expense is made up of labor and postage,
the latter being most important.</p>

<p>All enterprises of magnitude maintain a separate mailing department
in charge of one person, frequently the chief stenographer.
The very fact that postage is the big item of expense in the mailing
room, makes a very complete system of records absolutely essential.</p>

<p>The work of the mailing room consists of folding circulars and
letters, enclosing catalogs, circulars, and letters in envelopes, addressing,
filling in dates and addresses on printed form letters, and stamping.
Sometimes addressing and filling in is done in the stenography
division, but the more usual plan is to consider this a part of the mailing
expense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>Of first importance is a record of work done, which is best secured
by means of a daily report of the work of each clerk. All work should
be assigned by the head of the department, and the clerk required
to keep an accurate record of both time and production. This
question of assigning the work is especially important in the mailing
room, as one department may flood the room with work which, if
done, would make it impossible to handle the work of other departments
for several days. The head of the department must decide
which is the most important work. Sometimes it is necessary to
make out, in advance, a weekly schedule of circularizing to be done,
and compel all departments to be governed by the schedule. As
an alternative, some of the larger enterprises maintain a separate
mailing room, in charge of the advertising department, exclusively
for circularizing work.</p>

<p>A suitable form for the employe's daily report is shown in Fig.
12. This report is divided for a record of the different classes of
work performed. All work is recorded by number, that is, if the
work is folding circular <i>No. 518</i>, that number is placed in the first
column opposite <i>folding</i>. The center column is for the name of the
department; as a rule, the form number indicates the name of the
department, but sometimes the same form is used by several departments.
In the columns next following, the clerk enters the number
of pieces handled and the time taken. The extension columns,
showing rate and amount, are filled in by the head of the department.</p>

<p>From these reports, the pay-roll is made up. All of this work
can be handled on a piece-rate basis, and most large concerns find
this the most economical basis. The rate must necessarily be varied
to suit local conditions, and should be high enough that by doing a
full day's work a clerk will earn something more than the standard
day wage. For example, a girl will address from 1000 to 1500 envelopes,
or fill in addresses on the same number of form letters, in
a day of eight hours, the average being&mdash;say 1200. In different cities
the accepted wage standard for the class of help required in this work
varies from $5.00 to $7.00 a week. Where the $5.00 rate prevails, a
piece rate of 90 cents a thousand is equitable; a girl who maintains
an average of 1200 a day for five and one-half days (the usual time
required in an office) will earn $5.94 with a chance to earn still more
if she can increase her speed. The extra ninety-four cents is an inducement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
to at least equal the average; without it, she would probably
drop to 1000 or less. While her wage has been increased, the cost
has been lowered.</p>

<p><b>Daily Mail Report.</b> That the information may be in convenient
form for statistical purposes and for making final reports, there should
be a daily mail report. This report should be a complete record of
everything mailed, showing the number of pieces and the rate of
postage for each. A form for such a report is shown in Fig. 13. This
report is divided for a record of regular mail-letters, circulars, and
catalogs&mdash;and merchandise. The latter is not required in all cases,
but is very important for a concern doing a mail-order business in
small articles which can be sent by mail.</p>

clerk, without reference to the individual employes' reports, as it is
intended as a check against the latter. A memorandum of the number
of pieces reported for the different operations by the employes should
be kept, and at the end of the week compared
with the quantities shown by the
daily mail reports. For some of the
operations, the quantities reported by
employes may be the larger, certain work
being completed on matter which has not
been mailed. To reconcile this difference,
the work itself should be on hand in the mailing room.</p>

<p><b>Postage Record.</b> The most important of all records in the mailing
room is the postage record. Postage should be placed in charge
of the stamp clerk, who should be made responsible for its accounting.
The mail clerk is, in fact, a cashier, having the custody of the
equivalent of cash in the form of postage stamps. Unless a very
strict record is kept, there are abundant opportunities for thievery of
stamps and, because they are almost as easily disposed of as cash,
the temptation is strong. So great have the losses been from this
source, that the government now permits business houses to identify
its own stamps by means of perforations. There is now on the
market a machine which perforates the initials or trade mark of a
firm. The machine is very rapid in operation and stamps can be
perforated in sheets very quickly. An enlarged reproduction of a
stamp perforation is shown in Fig. 14.</p>

<p>The first step in providing for a complete postage record is to
make a voucher for postage required. The cashier should require
a voucher before supplying stamps or the money with which to buy
them. A special voucher form showing the postage on hand, and
the number of stamps of each denomination required, is shown in
Fig. 15. This should be made in duplicate; the original goes to the
cashier and the duplicate is retained by the stamp clerk.</p>

<p><b>Weekly Report.</b> From the daily mail reports, a weekly postage
report should be made. This report should show the total amount of
postage used, distributed by departments. A form for such a report
is shown in Fig. 16. In the first column the names of the departments
are written, and in the daily columns the amounts used are
recorded. The amount expended for registry and special delivery is
entered at the bottom of the sheet, and below this is a recapitulation
showing the balance of postage on hand. This report, which is made
by the head of the mailing room, should be in duplicate&mdash;one copy
for the accounting department, and one to be retained by the stamp
clerk.</p>

<p><b>Weekly Mailing Report.</b> The final report of the mailing room
is a weekly report which shows exactly what work has been done for
each department. The information required to make up this report
is obtained from the employes' daily reports, and the daily mail
reports. The postage is taken from the daily mail reports and
checked with the weekly postage report to guard against any inaccuracy.
A comprehensive form of report is shown in Fig. 17. This
report is made to the statistical department.</p>

<p><b>Stationery and Supplies.</b> Attention has already been called
to the necessity for the proper care of stationery and office supplies.
The losses due to careless handling of supplies are more serious than
is usually appreciated. Probably the best way to reduce this expense
is to require signed requisitions for all supplies drawn, and to charge
all supplies to the different departments. All departments should be
required to present requisitions once a day only, and then only during
certain hours. In very few offices is a stock clerk required for office
supplies alone; if the supplies are kept in the regular storeroom, or
if one of the office clerks has charge of the supply cabinet, this plan
will save time, as an hour a day is sufficient to handle the work in
almost any office.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>After posting the supplies records, the clerk in charge should
make a report to the statistical department of supplies drawn. This
may be a weekly report, as shown in Fig. 18. A second copy should
be made for the accounting department.</p>

<p>This report shows the value of supplies drawn each day by each
department. The amounts can be entered daily from the requisitions,
the totals being entered at the end of the week.</p>

<p><b>Summary of Administrative Expense.</b> The reports and records
described place the statistical department in a position to make complete
summaries of administrative expense. The salaries of department
and division heads, clerks, and stenographers employed in each
department are obtained from the accounting department; mailing
expense is obtained from the weekly report of the mailing clerk; cost
of supplies drawn is shown by the supplies clerk's report; the amount
of expense items not otherwise accounted for is supplied by the
accounting department. The last item named&mdash;representing overhead
expense&mdash;can be distributed to the departments on the basis
of the ratio of the known expense of each department&mdash;that is, if the
known expense, including salaries, mailing, and supplies, in one
department is 20% of the known expense of all departments, it may
be charged with 20% of the overhead.</p>

<p>Fig. 19 shows a form for a summary of all administrative expense,
the different classes of expense being divided for each department.
Totals of expense of each class, totals for each department, and the
grand total are shown. Totals of the different classes and the grand
total must agree with the records of the accounting department.
At the bottom of the administrative expense summary the per cent of
total administrative expense to sales and turnover&mdash;or cost of goods
sold&mdash;should be shown.</p>

<p><b>Profit and Loss Statements.</b> The profits shown by the comparative
trading statement, Fig. 9, are trading profits only&mdash;not net profits,
as administrative expense and profits from other sources than
sales are not included. A statement should be prepared, therefore,
which will show net profits. This can be combined with the trading
statement, but the better plan is to prepare a separate statement.
It is usually advisable to supply copies of the trading statement to
the heads of all departments of the sales division that each may see
what progress he is making, and compare it with that of other departments.
It is not advisable, however, to let the department heads
know the exact net profits; this information is for the general manager
and directors.</p>

<p>Fig. 20 shows a form of monthly profit and loss statement,
divided by departments. The totals for the fiscal year to the first of
the current month are brought forward at the head of the sheet;
then the figures for the current month are entered. Sales, sales
expense, and sales profits are taken from the trading statement;
administrative expense is shown by the summary, Fig. 19. Administrative
expense is charged to the different departments on the basis
of the turnover&mdash;that is, if the total administrative expense is 10%
of the total turnover, each department will be charged an amount
equal to 10% of its turnover.</p>

<p>There are certain profits which arise from other sources than the
sale of goods in which the concern is trading. Among other sources
are interest and premiums and profits on the sale of bonds and stocks.
All such items should be listed separately each month that the amount
of unusual profits may be known. This statement presents a history
of the progress of the business reduced to its final analysis&mdash;that of
actual net profits.</p>

<h3 class="p2">MAILING-ROOM MACHINERY</h3>

<p>Mechanical devices and machines are used for many purposes
in an office, and both the variety of uses and types of machines are
steadily increasing. Inventors and manufacturers of office appliances
are working constantly to perfect devices which will save time, insure
accuracy, and reduce costs. Among the important devices are several
designed to reduce labor and insure increased speed in the mailing
room.</p>

<p><b>Addressing Machines.</b> One of the most efficient labor-saving
devices is the addressing machine, which is used for addressing
envelopes, cards, and other matter, to a large list of names. These
machines are especially well adapted for the names to which communications
are addressed at regular intervals. Brokers and commission
men use them for addressing daily market letters to permanent
lists of correspondents; business houses in all lines find them
convenient for monthly statements, using the machine both for
addressing the envelopes and filling in the names on the statements.
An office boy can fill in addresses on statements for all accounts in
the sales ledger, and address the envelopes, saving about one-half
the time of the bookkeeper.</p>

<p>In the advertising and sales department, the addressing machine
is used to excellent advantage for addressing follow-up letters, booklets,
circulars, and catalogs. Its use makes it easy to send advertising
literature to all customers at frequent intervals. The machine
is not recommended for a prospective customer's follow-up list,
unless a large number of follow-ups are to be sent; but when a man
becomes a customer, it may be safely assumed that the name is permanent.</p>

<p>Of the machines now on the market, one of the best known is the
<i>addressograph</i>. This machine is made with both card addresses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
and chain addresses. The card machine, which is shown in Fig. 21,
is the most practical for the uses to which the machine is put in the
average office. With this machine, metal frames the size of an index
card are used. These frames are made in two styles, one of which
has a metal printing plate, while with the other, the name and
address are set in rubber type. With the first style, the printing
plate is made by stamping the letters on a sheet of metal. This
makes a permanent address, which cannot be changed without making
a new plate.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-360.jpg" width="400" height="518"

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 21. The Addressograph Addressing Machine<br />
<i>Addressograph Co.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>Fig. 22 shows the rubber type frame. The name and address
are set up in the type frame, and can be changed at will. Type<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
taken from old addresses can be used over and over again. When
an address is set, a proof is printed on a card, which is placed in the
upper half of the frame. This card is large enough for notations,
and can be arranged for recording any information desired.</p>

<p>The metal frames are provided with tabs printed with letters,
names of towns, numbers, or other special information, and are filed
in card drawers, as shown in Fig. 23. They may be filed in any of
the usual ways adapted for card systems; a customers' list may be
filed according to states and towns, and the names in a certain town
addressed without disturbing the balance of the list.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 22. Metal Frames for Rubber Type<br />
<i>The Addressograph Co.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>To operate the machine, the address plates are first transferred
to the magazine on top of the machine. The contents of a drawer
can be transferred without handling. The plates are automatically
fed to the printing point of the machine, from which they are returned
to the drawer, which is placed under the machine, in the exact order
in which they were filed. When the address frame reaches the printing
point, the address is plainly visible on the card, so that any name
can be skipped.</p>

<p>With an addressograph it is claimed that 3000 addresses an hour
can easily be made. This takes the place of several girls, and reduces
the cost to a minimum.</p>

<p><b>Folding Machines.</b> One of the most practical labor-saving
devices for the mailing room is the folding machine. Direct advertising,
by means of circular or form letters, and printed circulars, is
becoming more and more popular. Where such communications
were formerly
mailed in hundreds,
they are
now mailed in
thousands; it is
not uncommon
for a concern
using this form
of advertising to
mail a million
circulars or letters
on one proposition
in a single
season.</p>

<div class="floatright">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 24. Folding Machine Operated<br />by Electric Motor.<br /><i>A. B. Dick Co.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>To fold these
letters and circulars
in the ordinary
way is an
expensive task.
Not only is the
labor cost involved, but the question of space, which in many offices
is of even greater importance. While a plant occupying buildings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
owned by the company may be in a position to provide plenty of
space for offices, the great majority of businesses are conducted in
cramped office quarters; the modern office building with its high rents
tends to reduce office space to a minimum. As a result, many a business,
lacking room in which to work a large force of folders, has been
obliged to hire its extensive circularizing done outside of the office.</p>

<p>These difficulties have to a great extent been overcome by the
folding machine. For many years printers have made use of machines
for folding, but it was not until a comparatively recent date that a
machine adapted to office use was perfected. Now there are several
practical machines on the market.</p>

<p>One of these machines will fold from 4000 to 7000 letters or circulars
an hour, depending on the size and weight of the paper, and
the number of folds. This is equal to eight persons folding by hand,
and the machine and operator occupy no more space than one hand
folder.</p>

<p>The best machines are so made that they can be operated by
hand or electric power. Wherever electric lights are available, the
power machine can be used. Including the cost of power, the maximum
cost of folding with one of the machines is from 3 cents to 5
cents a thousand. One of the well-known types, with motor attached,
is shown in Fig. 24.</p>

<p><b>Mailing Machines.</b> To a concern mailing large quantities of
circular matter, an envelope sealer or mailing machine is indispensable.
Envelope sealers which worked in a more or less satisfactory manner
have been on the market for several years. These machines have
been improved, and their best features combined with new ideas,
until now machines are to be had which work perfectly.</p>

<p>Several of the machines seal envelopes only; one both seals the
envelopes and attaches the stamp. The combination sealing and
stamping machine seals, stamps, and counts envelopes at an average
rate of 8000 an hour, doing the work of from eight to ten clerks.</p>

<p>When sealed by the machine, the flaps of the envelopes are folded
tightly and securely sealed. The moistening device is so constructed
that the amount of moisture passing under each flap is regulated to
a nicety, preventing envelopes sticking together on account of too
much water being applied. Coincident with the sealing of an envelope,
the stamp is applied. Every envelope passing through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
machine is stamped; as a result, none are returned from the postoffice
for lack of postage.</p>

<div class="floatleft">
     <img src="images/ill-364.jpg" width="250" height="344"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 25. The Mailometer<br />Mailing Machine<br /><i>Mailometer Co.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>A special counting device automatically counts the stamps as
applied, the counter being in full view of the operator. This means
an absolute check on the postage account. The stamps are locked
in a glass case and, by moving a lever, the stamp mechanism can be
thrown out of operation. It can
only be made to apply stamps
again by unlocking the case,
which places the stamps absolutely
under the control of one
person.</p>

<p>After being sealed and counted,
the envelopes pass to a stacker,
all facing one way so that they
can be tied in bundles for sending
to the postoffice. This is a
point worthy of consideration
where dispatch in getting mail
out is of importance. Envelopes
of any size up to twelve inches are
handled, and by throwing off the
sealing device, mailing cards can
be stamped.</p>

<p>The machine referred to is
shown in Fig. 25. In operation, the mail is gathered and placed on
the rack shown at the top of the machine, with the flap of each
envelope overlapping the one next to it. The operator, taking a
bunch of about twenty-five envelopes from the rack, holds them
lightly against the feed rolls at the left of the machine. The automatic
feed separates the envelopes, permitting only one at a time
to pass its flap over a metal disc which revolves in water. As the envelope
is advanced, the stamps are fed forward, cut off, moistened,
and rolled upon the passing envelope. The stamps used in the
machine are put up in continuous-ribbon form, wound on a reel,
there being 3000 stamps on a reel. Until the government supplies
stamps in this form, they are being supplied by the manufacturers,
who have arranged with the government to make them to their order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Letter-Printing Machines.</b> The present extensive use of circular
or form letters is made possible by the use of letter-printing
machines. To write all of the letters on a typewriter is out of the
question, owing to the cost. Consequently, concerns doing any
considerable circularizing have resorted to imitation typewritten
letters.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div></div>

<p>For many purposes letters bring better results than printed
circulars, but without the personal touch&mdash;unless the recipient is made
to feel that the letter was written to him&mdash;a letter loses its force.
This fact makes the ordinary printed letter ineffective. An imitation
typewritten letter makes the personal appeal possible; if it is printed
from typewriter type in a color that matches the ribbon of the machine,
the name and address can we filled in, and it will look like a
typewritten letter.</p>

<p>Many printers have learned to produce satisfactory letters of
this character and, within the last few years, several printing machines,
designed for office use, have been put on the market. These machines
are adaptations of the printing-press idea. Letters are set
up as they would be for a printing press, typewriter type being used;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
but instead of printing from ink applied directly to the type, the
letters are printed through a large typewriter ribbon. Ribbons of
the same kind are used on the typewriter for filling in names and
addresses, which insures a perfect match. One of these machines
will print from 1000 to 2500 letters an hour.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 27. Multi-Copy Typewriter. <i>Multi-Copy Typewriter Co.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>There are two distinct types of machines, the cylinder machine
and the flat-bed machine. A well-known machine of the cylinder
type is shown in Fig. 26. The machine has two cylinders, one for
type storage and one for printing. The type is held in slots in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
it moves freely. To set up a letter on the printing cylinder, the
storage cylinder is revolved until the pointer at the top of the machine
reaches the desired letter, when a slight pressure of the finger on the
small lever in the center moves the type into the slot on the printing
cylinder. This is continued until the line is set, when the printing
cylinder is moved into position for the next line. To distribute the
type to the storage cylinder, this operation is reversed.</p>

<p>After the letter is set, a ribbon is drawn around the printing
cylinder, and the machine is ready to print. The paper is fed,
printing side up, underneath the cylinder. A turn of the crank
draws the paper through, prints it,
and discharges it at the back of the
machine. Special power attachments
can be put on which operate
both the machine itself and an automatic
feed, which greatly increases
the speed.</p>

<p>Machines of the flat-bed type
are shown in Figs. 27 and 28. With
these machines the type is kept in
cases, the compartments of which are arranged in the same order
as the keys on a typewriter. The type is set up and locked in a
chase, just as it is by a printer, and the chase placed on the flat bed
of the machine.</p>

<p>The ribbon is stretched tightly over the type, the printing being
done by moving an impression roller over the ribbon. Paper is
fed, one sheet at a time, against the paper guide, and the roller,
passing over, produces the desired printing impression. When the
roller is returned, the sheet is automatically ejected and counted.
The pressure and shade of the printing are regulated by the adjustment
of impression screws.</p>

<p>An advantage claimed for this type of machine is that electrotypes
and zinc etchings can be used, or regular printers' job type can
be substituted for printing small circulars and office forms. If a letter
or form is used frequently, it can be electrotyped and held permanently,
releasing the type.</p>
